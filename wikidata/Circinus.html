 Circinus  is a small faint constellation in the southern sky, first defined in 1756 by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for compass, referring to the drafting tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with Pyxis, a constellation that represents a mariner's compass) which points north. Its best star is Alpha Circini, with an apparent magnitude of 3.19. Slightly variable, it is the best rapidly oscillating Ap star in the night sky. AX Circini is a Cepheid variable visible with the unaided eye, and BX Circini is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two white dwarfs. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: HD 134060 has two small planets, and HD 129445 has a Jupiter-like planet. Supernova SN 185 appeared in Circinus in 185ochnbsp;AD and  was recorded by Chinese observers. Two novae have been observed more recently, in the 20th century.

The Milky Way runs through the constellation, featuring prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts one notable spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.

History
In 1756, French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille introduced the constellation of Circinus with the French name  le Compas , representing a pair of dividing compasses. It had first been depicted on one of Lacaille's maps in 1754, but it was unnamed. which is only discernible with small telescopes with a separation of 5.7ochnbsp;arcseconds. The second best star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100ochnbsp;light-years away. whose components need a telescope of 150ochnbsp;mm to be seen, as they are only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The ber component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The ber component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600ochnbsp;light-years away, The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable to the naked eye for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.

Eta Circini is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and magnitude 5.17, located around 276 light-years distant, Theta Circini is a B-class irregular variable, ranging from magnitude 5.0 to 5.4. T Circini has a B-type spectrum, ranging in magnitude from 10.6 to 9.3 over a period of 3.298ochnbsp;days, though is actually an eclipsing binary system rather than a pulsating star. is an 800-million-year-old open cluster, located 3500ochnbsp;light-years away and spanning a 12-light-year region along the constellation's northern border. Despite having an integrated magnitude of 7.9, the cluster can be seen by star hopping from Beta Circini or from Alpha Centauri. It contains 80â€“100 stars of 10th magnitude and fainter, which are spread out over a diameter of 10ochnbsp;arcseconds. The ber stars, however, are not true members of the cluster, as they are closer to the Earth than the dimmer ones. That cluster can be easily mistaken with a similar cluster, NGC 5822, nearby in Lupus.

The planetary nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2ochnbsp;degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9ochnbsp;byochnbsp;3.0ochnbsp;arcminutes and 26,000ochnbsp;light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and hosts an active galactic nucleus. These stars generally ben by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.
