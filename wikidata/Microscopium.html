 Microscopium   is a small constellation in the southern sky, defined in the 18th century by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Its best star is Gamma Microscopii of apparent magnitude 4.68, actually a yellow giant located around 381 light-years distant. Two star systems—WASP-7 and HD 205739—have been found to have planets, while another—AU Microscopii—has a debris disk.

History
Seen in the 1824 star chart set  Urania's Mirror  (in the lower )
The stars that now comprise Microscopium may formerly have belonged to the hind feet of Sagittarius.  However, this is uncertain as, while its stars seem to be referred to by Al-Sufi as having been seen by Ptolemy, Al-Sufi does not specify their exact positions.

Its name is Latin for microscope; it was called this due to its visual similarity to 18th century microscope. Its stars are very faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical northern hemisphere.

The former constellation Neper, representing an auger, may have been located in or near modern-day Microscopium. However, this connection is disputed.

Characteristics
The constellation Microscopium as it can be seen by the naked eye.

Microscopium is a small constellation bordered by Capricornus to the north, Piscis Austrinus and Grus to the west, Sagittarius to the east, Indus to the south, and touching on Telescopium to the southeast. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Mic'. It depicts the eyepiece of the microscope. and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.

Many notable objects are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. AX Microscopii, better known as Lacaille 8760, is a red dwarf which lies only 12.9 light years from our solar system. HD 205739 has a jupiter-sized planet. WASP-7 is a star of magnitude 9.54 which has been discovered to have an exoplanet WASP-7b, and AU Microscopii is a young star which appears to be a solar system in the making with a debris disk. BO Microscopii is a rapidly rotating star, and PSR J2144-3933 is an unusual pulsar with an unusually long rotation period.

NGC 6925 is a barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.3 which is lens-shaped  as it lies almost edge on to us. It lies 3.7 degrees westnorthwest of Alpha Microscopii. NGC 6923 lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still.
