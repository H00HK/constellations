Canis Major is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to Canis Minor, the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter. The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders.

Canis Major contains Sirius, the best star in the night sky, known as the 'dog star'. It is b because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other b stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity. At magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara) is the second best star of the constellation and one of the best sources of ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in bness are the yellow-white supergiant Delta (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and Omicron1 at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars known, while the neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere 5ochnbsp;km.

History and mythology 
In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, was seen as an arrow, aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN, in the  Three Stars Each  tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled  MUL.APIN , the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism  Húshǐ  (弧矢), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing Delta, Epsilon, Eta and Kappa Canis Majoris and Delta Velorum, or that the arrow was Omicron2 and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf) and the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, Sigma, Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and Pi and Omicron Puppis.

Both the Maori people and the people of the Tuamotus recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations.  Te Huinga-o-Rehua , also called  Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua  and  Te Kahui-Takurua , ("The Assembly of Rehua" or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars. Related was  Taumata-o-Rehua , also called  Pukawanui , the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major. They called Sirius  Rehua  and  Takarua , corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though  Rehua  was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies. The Tuamotu people called Canis Major  Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua , "the abiding assemblage of Takurua".

The Tharumba people of the Shoalhaven River saw three stars of Canis Major as  Wunbula  (Bat) and his two wives  Murrumbool  (Mrs Brown Snake) and  Moodtha  (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation  Munowra . a red supergiant of spectral type K7Ib that varies irregularly between magnitudes 3.43 and 3.51. it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now undergoing nuclear fusion of helium to generate energy. its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. Kappa is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable of spectral type B2Vne,

Canis Major is also home to many variable stars. EZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766 days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation.

Tau Canis Majoris is a Beta Lyrae-type eclipsing multiple star system that varies from magnitude 4.32 to 4.37 over 1.28 days.Located around 30' northeast of NGC 2360, NGC 2359 (Thor's Helmet or the Duck Nebula) is a relatively b emission nebula in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by HD 56925, an unstable Wolf-Rayet star embedded within it.

In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears to be part of the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead be of extragalactic origin.

ESO 489-056 is an irregular dwarf galaxy, located 16 million light-years distant. 

NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are a pair of face-on interacting spiral galaxies located 125 million light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive star formation in both galaxies. Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia SN 1975a), 1999 (the type Ib SN 1999ec), 2003 (type 1b supernova SN 2003H), and 2013 (type II supernova SN 2013ai).
