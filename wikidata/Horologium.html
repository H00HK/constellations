Horologium is a small and faint constellation in the southern sky (declination around −60 degrees). Its name is a Latin transliteration of the Greek word for clock (Horo [ὥρο]- meaning hour and logium [λέγειν] meaning teller [horologium= the hour-teller]).

History
Horologium was plotted in the 18th century by Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. He originally labeled it Horologium Oscillitorium, the Latin name for a pendulum clock, to honour its inventor Christiaan Huygens and his book Horologium Oscillatorium.

Beta Horologii is a white giant of magnitude 5.0, 314 light-years from Earth. However, Horologium does have several variable stars. R Horologii is a red giant Mira variable with a very wide range, 1000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 14.3 and a maximum magnitude of 4.7; its period is approximately 13 months.

Deep-sky objects
Horologium is also not home to many deep-sky objects; there are several globular clusters in the constellation. NGC 1261 is a globular cluster of magnitude 8, 44,000 light-years from Earth.The globular cluster Arp-Madore 1 is found in the constellation, the most remotely known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a distance of 398,000 light years.
