 Musca  () is a small constellation in the deep southern sky. It was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14ochnbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's  Uranometria  of 1603. It was also known as  Apis  () for two hundred years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

Many of the constellation's ber stars are members of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share a common origin and motion across the Milky Way. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Zeta2 and (likely) Eta Muscae, as well as HD 100546, a blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star that is surrounded by a complex debris disk containing a large planet or brown dwarf and possible protoplanet. Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two Cepheid variables visible to the naked eye. Theta Muscae is a triple star system, the best member of which is a Wolf–Rayet star.

 History 
Musca (as Apis) can be seen in the upper  of this extract from Bayer's  Uranometria  of 1603
Musca was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the  Eerste Schipvaart , to the East Indies. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name  De Vlieghe , "The Fly". They assigned four stars to the constellation, with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head, Gamma the body, and Alpha and Delta the  and  wings respectively. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14ochnbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius, though was unnamed. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer's  Uranometria  of 1603,<!-- cites previous three sentences --> though Bayer termed it Apis— the Bee , a name by which it was known for the next two centuries. A 1603 celestial globe by Willem Blaeu depicts it as providing nourishment for the nearby constellation Chamaeleon—its tongue trying to catch the insect. It is the only official constellation depicting an insect.}}

The constellation Musca as it can be seen by the naked eye
Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu but did not designate them as he considered them  informes  as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the ber one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation.

The pattern of the best stars resembles that of Ursa Minor, in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of a bowl with a handle. Lying south-southeast of Acrux in neighbouring Crux is Alpha Muscae. a blue-white star of spectral type B5V that varies between magnitudes 3.84 and 3.86 over a period of 2.7ochnbsp;days. It is a variable of a different type, classed as a 53 Persei variable, a type of slowly pulsating variable. With an apparent magnitude of 3.62, Delta is an orange giant of spectral type K2III located around 91ochnbsp;light-years away. Epsilon Muscae is a red giant of spectral type M5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.31 over approximately 40ochnbsp;days. a Classical Cepheid variable ranging from apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5ochnbsp;days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500ochnbsp;light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, HD 100546 is a young blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequence—the closest of these stars to Earth at around 320ochnbsp;light-years distant. estimated to be around 1750ochnbsp;light-years away from Earth. thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border.

The comparatively old globular cluster NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200ochnbsp;light-years distant and somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more arc minutes.<!-- cites previous two sentences --> It is 18,900ochnbsp;light-years away from Earth and 23,000ochnbsp;light-years distant from the centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way.<!-- cites previous two sentences --> Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a b field of stars.
