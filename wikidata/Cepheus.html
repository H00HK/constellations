History and mythology
Cepheus was the King of Aethiopia. He was married to Cassiopeia and was the father of Andromeda, both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus.

Notable features





The constellation Cepheus as it can be seen by the naked eye.





Stars
Alpha Cephei, traditionally called "Alderamin", is a white hued star of magnitude 2.5, 49 light-years from Earth. Beta Cephei, traditionally called "Alfirk", is a double star with a blue-hued giant primary of magnitude 3.2 and a secondary of magnitude 7.9. The primary is a variable star considered to be the prototype of its subclass of pulsating variable stars, which are sometimes named for Beta Canis Majoris. Beta Cephei variables do not have wide ranges in magnitude, nor do they have periods longer than a few hours. Beta Cephei itself varies 0.1 magnitudes every 4.6 hours. Its traditional name means "flock" and refers to a flock of sheep. Gamma Cephei, traditionally called Errai, is an orange-hued star of magnitude 3.2, 45 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means "the shepherd". It is a binary star approximately 50 light years away from Earth. The system consists of an orange subgiant and a red dwarf. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, γ Cephei will be the pole star between AD 3000 and 5200, with the closest approach to the celestial pole around AD 4000. The primary component is orbited by a planet.[citation needed]

δ Cephei is the prototype Cepheid variable, a yellow-hued supergiant star 980 light-years from Earth. It was discovered to be variable by John Goodricke in 1784. It varies between 3.5m and 4.4m over a period of 5 days and 9 hours. The Cepheids are a class of pulsating variable stars; Delta Cephei has a minimum size of 40 solar diameters and a maximum size of 46 solar diameters. It is also a double star; the yellow star also has a wide-set blue-hued companion of magnitude 6.3.

There are several other prominent variable stars in Cepheus. One, μ Cephei, is also known as Herschel's Garnet Star due to its deep red colour. It is a semiregular variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.4. Its period is approximately 2 years. The star is around 11.8 AU in radius. If it were placed at the centre of our Solar System, it would extend to the orbit of Saturn.[citation needed] Another, VV Cephei, like Mu Cephei, is a red supergiant and a semiregular variable star, located at least 2000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.8. One of the largest stars in the galaxy, it has a diameter of over 1000 solar diameters. VV Cephei is also an unusually long-period eclipsing binary, but the eclipses, which occur every 20.3 years, are too faint to be observed with the unaided eye. T Cephei, also a red giant, is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 11.3 and a maximum magnitude of 5.2, 685 light-years from Earth. It has a period of 13 months and a diameter of 500 solar diameters.

There are several prominent double stars and binary stars in Cepheus. Omicron Cephei is a binary star with a period of 800 years. The system, 211 light-years from Earth, consists of an orange-hued giant primary of magnitude 4.9 and a secondary of magnitude 7.1. Xi Cephei is another binary star, 102 light-years from Earth, with a period of 4000 years. It has a blue-white primary of magnitude 4.4 and a yellow secondary of magnitude 6.5.

Kruger 60 is an 11th magnitude binary star consisting of two red dwarfs. The star system is one of the nearest, being only 13 light years away from Earth.[citation needed]

Deep-sky objects





NGC 7354 is a planetary nebula located in the constellation Cepheus.






NGC 188 is an open cluster that has the distinction of being the closest open cluster to the north celestial pole, as well as one of the oldest known open clusters.
The Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946) is a spiral galaxy in which nine supernovae have been observed, more than in any other galaxy.
IC 469 is another spiral galaxy, characterized by a compact nucleus, of oval shape, with perceptible side arms.
The nebula NGC 7538 is home to the largest yet discovered protostar.
NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula with an associated star cluster (Collinder 429); it has an overall magnitude of 7.7 and is 1400 light-years from Earth. The nebula and cluster are located near Beta Cephei and T Cephei.

Visualizations





Cepheus as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825.





Cepheus is most commonly depicted as holding his arms aloft, praying for the gods to spare the life of Andromeda. He is also depicted as a more regal monarch sitting on his throne.

Equivalents
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of the constellation Cepheus are found in two areas: the Purple Forbidden enclosure (紫微垣, Zǐ Wēi Yuán) and the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ).

In popular culture

In the TV sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun, the aliens' home planet is stated to be located in a barred spiral galaxy on the Cepheus-Draco border.
The performer Deadmau5 named his song, "HR 8938 Cephei" after a star in the constellation.

Centro Pedagógico – UFMG
A computer, which is the host for a shared printer was named after it.

Namesakes
USS Cepheus (AKA-18) and USS Cepheus (AK-265), United States navy ships.
