 Corona Borealis   is a small constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for "northern crown", a name inspired by its shape; its main stars form a semicircular arc. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

The best star is the 2.2-magnitude Alpha Coronae Borealis. Four star systems have been found to have exoplanets to date; three of these are orange giants, while the fourth—Rho Coronae Borealis—is a solar twin, very like our own Sun. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster located one billion light-years from our Solar System containing over 400 members, the best of which are 16th magnitude.

 Characteristics 
Corona Borealis is a small constellation bordered by Bootes to the north and west, Serpens Caput to the south, and Hercules to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'CrB'.

In November 2013 astronomers discovered the largest structure in the universe that was found within this constellation, the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall.

 History and mythology 
In Greek mythology, Corona Borealis was sometimes considered to represent a crown that was given by Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete. When she wore the crown to her wedding, where she married Dionysus, he placed her crown in the heavens to commemorate the wedding. In Welsh mythology, it was called Caer Arianrhod, "the Castle of the Silver Circle", and was the heavenly abode of the Lady Arianrhod (Squire, 2000:154–155). In Arabic mythology, the constellation was known as "the bowl of the poor people" from the Arabic name قصعة المساكين, since the stars form an unsymmetrical pattern with an indent in one side, similar to the bowl of the poor. The Arabs also called the constellation Alphecca (a name later given to Alpha Corona Borealis), which means "separated" or "broken up," a reference to the resemblance of the stars of Corona Borealis to a loose string of jewels.

 Equivalents 

In Australian Aboriginal astronomy, the constellation is called  womera  ("the boomerang") due to the shape of the stars.

The Wailwun people of northwestern New South Wales saw Corona Borealis as  mullion wollai  "eagle's nest", with Altair and Vega—each called  mullion —the pair of eagles accompanying it.

The Cheyenne nation of Native Americans called the main stars of this constellation the "Camp Circle" as they arranged their camps in a semicircle. Native Americans also used stars to make designs in the ground at the Medicine Wheel in Bighorn National Forest, Wyoming, USA.

In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Corona Borealis are located within the Heavenly Market enclosure (天市垣,  Tiān Shì Yuán )

Polynesian peoples often recognized Corona Borealis; it was likely called  Te Hetu  in the Tuamotus, whose people called the constellation  Na Kaua-ki-tokerau . In Hawaii, the constellation was likely called  Kaua-mea ; it was called  Rangawhenua  in New Zealand. The figure of Corona Borealis was called  Te Wale-o-Awitu  in Pukapuka. Its name in Tonga was unsure; it was either called  Ao-o-Uvea  or  Kau-kupenga .
