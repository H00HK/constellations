 Sagitta  is a constellation. Its name is Latin for "arrow", and it should not be confused with the larger constellation Sagittarius, the archer. Although Sagitta is an ancient constellation, it has no star ber than 3rd magnitude and has the third-smallest area of all constellations (only Equuleus and Crux are smaller). It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. Located to the north of the equator, Sagitta can be seen from every location on Earth except within the Antarctic circle.

Sagitta lies within the Milky Way and is bordered by the following constellations (beginning at the north and then continuing clockwise): the little fox Vulpecula, the mythological hero Hercules, the eagle Aquila and the dolphin Delphinus.

Stars
The following are some of Sagitta's best stars:
 
 α Sge: also known as  Sham , this yellow b giant star of spectral class G1ochnbsp;II (with 4.37m) lies at a distance of 610 light-years and together with β Sge (also 4.37m) forms either the feathers of the shaft or the two-pointed arrow once used in the Roman army.
 γ Sge: this cool giant (M0ochnbsp;III, 3.47m) represents with the stars δ Sge and ε Sge the shaft. It lies at a distance of merely 170 light-years.
 δ Sge: M2ochnbsp;II+A0ochnbsp;V (suspected visual double; probably single image, composite spectrum), 3.82m
 ε Sge: G8ochnbsp;III, 5.66m, multiple star (4 components; component B is optical)
 η Sge: this star of spectral class K2ochnbsp;III with 5.1m belongs to the Hyades moving group.

Deep-sky objects
 M71: this object is a very loose globular cluster mistaken for quite some time for a dense open cluster. It lies at a distance of about 13,000 light-years from Earth and was first discovered by the French astronomer Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in the year 1745 or 1746.
