 Aquila  is a constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology.

Aquila lies just a few degrees North of the celestial equator. The alpha star, Altair, is a vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies.

History
The constellation Aquila as it can be seen by the naked eye.
The former constellation Antinous was merged into Aquilla in 1930, but both can be seen in this 1825 chart from  Urania's Mirror .
Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as  Vultur volans  (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with  Vultur cadens  which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle who held Zeus's/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle who kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.

Ptolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined twenty-three stars in the first

The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation.

 α Aql (Altair)  is the best star in this constellation and one of the closest naked-eye stars to Earth at a distance of 17 light-years. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase "al-nasr al-tair", meaning "the flying eagle". Altair has a magnitude of 0.76.

 β Aql (Alshain)  is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.7, 45 light-years from Earth. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase "shahin-i tarazu", meaning "the balance"; this name referred to Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed.

 γ Aql (Tarazed)  is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.7, 460 light-years from Earth. Its name, like that of Alshain, comes from the Arabic for "the balance", "shahin-i tarazu".

 ζ Aql  is a blue-white-hued star of magnitude 3.0, 83 light-years from Earth.

 η Aql  is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 1200 light-years from Earth. Among the best Cepheid variable stars, it has a minimum magnitude of 4.4 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5 with a period of 7.2ochnbsp;days.

 15 Aql  is an optical double star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 5.4, 325 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-hued star of magnitude 7.0, 550 light-years from Earth. The pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.

 57 Aql  is a binary star. The primary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 6.5. The system is approximately 350 light-years from Earth; the pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.

 R Aql  is a red-hued giant star 690 light-years from Earth. It is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 12.0, a maximum magnitude of 6.0, and a period of approximately 9ochnbsp;months. It has a diameter of 400 D<sub>☉</sub>.

 FF Aql  is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is a Cepheid variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.7, a maximum magnitude of 5.2, and a period of 4.5ochnbsp;days.

 ρ Aql  moved across the border into neighboring Delphinus in 1992.

Novae
Two major novae have been observed in Aquila: the first one was in 389ochnbsp;BC and was recorded as being as b as Venus; the other (Nova Aquilae 1918) briefly shone ber than Altair, the best star in Aquila.

Deep-sky objects
IRAS 19024+0044 is a protoplanetary nebula in Aquila.
Three interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila:
NGC 6804 shows a small but b ring
NGC 6781 which bears some resemblance with the Owl Nebula in Ursa Major.
NGC 6751: also known as the Glowing Eye, a planetary nebula
More deep-sky objects:
NGC 6709 is a loose open cluster containing approximately 40 stars, which range in magnitude from 9 to 11. It is approximately 3000 light-years from Earth. It has an overall magnitude of 6.7 and is approximately 9100 light-years from Earth. NGC 6709 appears in a rich Milky Way star field and is classified as a Shapley class d and Trumpler class III 2ochnbsp;m cluster. These designations mean that it does not have many stars, is loose, does not show greater concentration at the center, and has a moderate range of star magnitudes.
NGC 6755: an open cluster of 7.5m; it is made up of about a dozen stars with magnitudes 12 through 13
NGC 6760: a globular cluster of 9.1m
NGC 6749: an open cluster
NGC 6778: planetary nebula
NGC 6741: planetary nebula
NGC 6772: planetary nebula

Other
NASA's Pioneer 11 space probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s, is expected to pass near the star Lambda (λ) Aquilae in about 4ochnbsp;million years.

Illustrations
In illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and best of these three stars is Altair. The tips of the wings extend further to the southeast and northwest. The head of the eagle stretches off to the southwest.

Mythology

Aquila, with the now-obsolete figure of Antinous, as depicted by Sidney Hall in  Urania's Mirror , a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. At  is Delphinus.

According to Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man (LU.USH) in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the Classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede.

In classical Greek mythology, Aquila was identified as Αετός Δίας ( Aetos Dios ), the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus and was sent by him to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede, whom he desired, to Mount Olympus; the constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede.

In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Niu Lang (Altair) and his two children (β and γ Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu (Vega) who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way.

In Hinduism, the constellation Aquila is identified with the half-eagle half-human deity Garuda.

Equivalents
In Chinese astronomy, ζ Aql is located within the Heavenly Market Enclosure (天市垣,  Tiān Shì Yuán ), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武,  Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ ).

There were several different Polynesian equivalents to Aquila as a whole. On the island of Futuna, it was called  Kau-amonga , meaning "Suspended Burden". Its name references the Futunan name for Orion's belt and sword,  Amonga . In Hawaii, Altair was called  Humu , after the humu humu fish, and the whole constellation was called  Humu-ma , the "Humu cluster".  Humu-ma  was said to influence the astrologers.  Pao-toa  was the name for the entire constellation in the Marquesas Islands; the name meant "Fatigued Warrior". There were also Polynesian constellations that incorporated the stars of modern Aquila. The Pukapuka constellation  Tolu , meaning "three", was made up of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Aquilae. Altair was commonly named among Polynesian peoples as well. The people of Hawaii called it  Humu , the people of the Tuamotus called it  Tukituki  ("Pound with a hammer") - they named Beta Aquilae  Nga Tangata  ("The Men") - and the people of Pukapuka called Altair  Turu  and used it as a navigational star. The Maori people named Altair  Poutu-te-rangi , "Pillar of the Sky", because of its important position in their cosmology. It was used differently in different Maori calendars, being the star of February and March in one version and March and April in the other. Altair was also the star that ruled the annual sweet potato harvest.

Namesakes
Two United States Navy ships, USS Aquila (AK-47) and USS Aquila (PHM-4), are named after the constellation.
