 Coma Berenices  is a traditional asterism that has since been defined as one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located near Leo, to which it formerly belonged, and accommodates the North Galactic Pole. Its name means "Berenice's Hair" (in Greek, via Latin), and refers to the legend of Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who sacrificed her long hair.

 History and mythology 
Coma Berenices is one of the few constellations to owe its name to a historical figure, in this case Queen Berenice II of Egypt, wife of  Ptolemy III Euergetes ( fl.  246 BC–221 BC), the king under whom Alexandria became an important cultural center.

In 243 BC, during the Third Syrian War, Ptolemy undertook a dangerous expedition against the Seleucids, who had murdered his sister. His newlywed bride, Berenice, swore to the goddess Aphrodite to sacrifice her long, blonde hair, of which she was extremely proud, if her husband returned safely. He did, so she cut her hair and placed it in the goddess's temple. By the next morning the hair had disappeared. To appease the furious king the court astronomer, Conon, announced that the offering had so pleased the goddess that she had placed it in the sky. He indicated a cluster of stars that have since been called Berenice's Hair. specifically, the tuft at the end of the lion's tail.

Tycho Brahe, who is usually given credit for Coma's promotion to constellation status, listed it in his star catalogue of 1602, but it originally occurred on a celestial globe by the cartographer Caspar Vopel from 1536. Gerardus Mercator has also been credited as its promoter in 1551. Coma Berenices and the now-defunct constellation Antinous are considered to be the first post-Ptolemaic constellations to be depicted on a celestial globe.

It appeared in Johann Bayer's  Uranometria  of 1603, and during the 17th century, a few other maps that were made of the sky followed suit.

 Notable features 
The constellation Coma Berenices as it can be seen by the naked eye.
NGC 4565 has been nicknamed the Needle Galaxy because, when seen in full, it appears as a very narrow streak of light on the sky.  

Although Coma Berenices is not a large constellation, it contains eight Messier objects.  The constellation is rich in galaxies, containing the northern part of the Virgo cluster.  There are also several globular clusters to be seen.  These objects can be seen with minimal obscuration from dust because the constellation is not in the direction of the galactic plane.  However, because of this fact, there are few open clusters (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse nebulae, or planetary nebulae.

 Stars 
Coma Berenices is not particularly b, having no stars ber than fourth magnitude.  Beta Comae Berenices is the best star in the constellation, at magnitude 4.2; it is 30 light-years from Earth.  Like the Sun, it is a yellow-hued main-sequence star. It is intrinsically only slightly ber than the Sun, which gives an idea of how faint the Sun would appear seen from Beta Comae's distance.

The second best star in Coma Berenices is α Comae Berenices also called Diadem. The name represents the gem in Berenice's crown. It is a binary star, with two components of almost equal magnitude. To the naked eye, it appears to be one star of magnitude 4.3. Because the orbital plane is so close to the Earth's line of sight, it was long suspected of being an eclipsing binary, but it now appears that the orbital tilt is 0.1° relative to the line of sight, so the stars do not eclipse each other as seen from Earth.
NGC 4565, the Needle galaxy
NGC 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years.  It is unique for its region of intense star formation that creates a ring around the nucleus, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope. The prodigious star formation began a short 5 million years ago and is in a region with a diameter of only 1,000 light-years. The architecture of the core is further unique because the small ring itself has spiral arms that feed gas into the bar.

NGC 4565 is a very well known edge-on spiral galaxy. It is of the 10th magnitude and appears superimposed on the Virgo Cluster, though it is only 20 million light-years from Earth. Like many edge-on spiral galaxies, it has a prominent dust lane and a central bulge.

NGC 4676, sometimes called the "Mice" galaxies, is a pair of interacting galaxies at a distance of 300 million light-years from Earth. The progenitor galaxies were both spiral galaxies; astronomers estimate that they had their closest approach about 160 million years ago. That close approach caused large regions of star formation in both galaxies, along with long "tails" of dust, stars, and gas. The two progenitor galaxies are predicted to interact significantly at least one more time before completely merging into a larger, probably elliptical galaxy.

 Quasars 
Quasar PG1247+26° is the best quasar visible in Coma Berenices.  As well, W Com was originally identified as a variable star and so given a variable star designation, but later discovered to be a BL Lacertae object.  It is normally around magnitude 16.5 m, but has been known to reach 12th magnitude.

 Other 
Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole, at  ascension  and declination  (epoch J2000.0).

 Meteor showers 
The December Coma Berenicids are a meteor shower that lasts from December through January; it peaks between December 18 and 25.

Equivalents

In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Coma Berenices are located in two areas: the Supreme Palace enclosure (太微垣,  Tài Wēi Yuán ) and the Azure Dragon of the East (東方青龍,  Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng ).

The asterism of Coma Berenices was recognized by several Polynesian peoples. The people of Pukapuka likely called it  Te Yiku-o-te-kiole ; the people of Tonga had three different names. These included  Fatana-lua ,  Fata-olunga  (also  Fata-lalo), and  Kapakau-o-Tafahi .
