 Norma  is a small and inconspicuous constellation in the southern hemisphere between Scorpius and Centaurus. Its name is Latin for normal, referring to a  angle, and is variously considered to represent a rule, a carpenter's square, a set square or a level.

History
Norma, originally named  l’Equerre et la Regle  in French, was one of the constellations invented by Abbé de Lacaille in the middle of the 1750s, when he was measuring about 10,000 stars at the Cape of Good Hope. Norma represents a carpenter's square, used in the Age of Exploration by carpenters on exploratory vessels.

Notable features
The constellation Norma as it can be seen by the naked eye.

Stars
The Milky Way passes through Norma.

Norma has no α or β star. These are now officially part of Scorpius - N Sco and H Sco respectively. Norma's best star, γ2 Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Among the constellation's principal stars are the following:

γ1 Nor and γ2 Nor comprise an easy optical double. γ2ochnbsp;Nor is itself a close optical double (HJ 4841).

ε Nor: a relatively fixed binary star (HJ 4853). The two components are of magnitude 4.54 and 6.68; the separation is 22" in PA 335°. The fainter component is itself a spectroscopic binary (mag 6.68 and 7.12).

ι1 Nor: a multiple star. The AB (mag 5.6 and 5.8) pair comprise a rapid binary with a period of 26.9 years; in 2000 the separation was 0.5" in PA 285°. Component C, of magnitude 8.75, is 11" away in PA 242°; it is not a physical member of the system, being only 55 light-years away, while the AB pair lie at a distance of more than 140 ly.

μ Nor is suspected of being an Alpha Cygni variable, with a range of 4.87–4.98. It is of spectral type O9.7ochnbsp;Iab.

R Normae is a Mira variable. Its visual range is 6.5–13.9 and its average period is 507.5 days.

S Normae is a well-known Cepheid variable with a range of 6.12–6.77 and a period of 9.75411 days. It is located at the centre of the open cluster NGC 6087.

Deep-sky objects
Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects, the most notable of which is NGC 6087.

NGC 6067 is an open cluster, which lies less than 1° north of Kappa Normae. It contains about 100 stars of the tenth magnitude and has an integrated magnitude of 5.6m.

NGC 6087 is the best of the open clusters in Norma; it lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between α Centauri and ζ Arae. It is about 3500 light-years away and contains about 40 stars of the seventh to the eleventh magnitude. Its best member is the Cepheid variable S Normae. It is of magnitude +5.4.

Sp 1 (or PKochnbsp;329+02.1) is a planetary nebula better known as the  Fine-Ring Nebula . It lies about five degrees west-northwest of γ1ochnbsp;Nor, though its actual distance has been variously estimated at 1000–4700 ly. Its integrated magnitude is 13.6 and its mean surface bness is 13.9. The central star is a white dwarf of mag 14.03.

Abell 3627, also called the Norma Cluster, is a galaxy cluster located at a distance of approximately 200 million light-years from Earth with a redshift of 0.016. It is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass, and is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600-1000 kilometers per second.
