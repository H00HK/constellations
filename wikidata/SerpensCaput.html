 Serpens  ("the Serpent", Greek ) is a constellation of the northern hemisphere. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.

It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts,  Serpens Caput  (Serpent's Head) to the west and  Serpens Cauda  (Serpent's Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the "Serpent-Bearer".  In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between μ Ser in  Serpens Caput  and ν Ser in  Serpens Cauda . The best star in Serpens is Unukalhai or  Cor Serpentis  "Serpent's Heart", with an apparent magnitude of 2.63.

History
[[Serpens held by Ophiuchus, as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825. Above the tail of the serpent is the now-obsolete constellation Taurus Poniatovii while below it is Scutum.]]
<!-- needs more Greek Mythology -->
Aratus describes the constellation as follows:
 Both [hands of Ophiuchus] firmly clutch the Serpent, which encircles the waist of Ophiuchus, but he, steadfast with both his feet well set, tramples a huge monster, even the Scorpion, standing up on his eye and breast. Now the Serpent is wreathed about his two hands – a little above his  hand, but in many folds high above his . ... Toward the Crown leans the Serpent’s jaw, but beneath his coiling form seek thou for the mighty Claws [Libra] 

There were two "serpent" constellations in Babylonian astronomy, known as Mušḫuššu and Bašmu. It appears that Mušḫuššu was depicted as a hybrid of dragon, lion and bird, and loosely corresponds to Hydra.
Bašmu was a horned serpent (c.f. Ningishzida) and loosely corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of Eudoxus of Cnidus on which the  Ὄφις ( Serpens ) of Ptolemy is based.

 Characteristics 
Serpens is unique among the 88 modern constellations in that it is split into two separate parts:  Serpens Caput  and  Serpens Cauda , the head and tail respectively. The constellation is also one of the only ones that is dependent on another constellation for context; specifically, its being held by Ophiuchus.

Serpens Caput's boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 15-sided polygon, while Serpens Cauda's are defined by a 25-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the  ascension coordinates of Serpens Caput's borders lie between  and , while the declination coordinates are between  and . Serpens Cauda's boundaries lie between  ascensions of  and  and declinations of  and .

Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is located 250 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0181). It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core.

Seyfert's Sextet is a group of six galaxies, four of which are interacting gravitationally and two of which simply appear to be a part of the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0145) and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy clusters known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. Despite its fame, the Eagle Nebula is fairly dim, with an integrated magnitude of approximately 6.0. The star-forming regions in the nebula are often evaporating gaseous globules; unlike Bok globules they only hold one protostar.

MWC 922 is a star surrounded by a planetary nebula. Dubbed the Red Square Nebula due to its similarities to the Red Rectangle Nebula, the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions. The nebula contains concentric rings, which are similar to those seen in the supernova SN 1987A. MWC 922 itself is an FS Canis Majoris variable, meaning that it is a Be star containing exceptionally b hydrogen emission lines as well as select forbidden lines, likely due to the presence of a close binary.

The Serpens South star cluster was uncovered by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in the southern portion of the Serpens cloud. The discovery was possible due to the infrared observation capabilities of the SST because at visible wavelengths the stars are completely obscured by interstellar dust in the Serpens cloud.

 Meteor showers 
There are two daytime meteor showers that radiate from Serpens, the Omega Serpentids and the Sigma Serpentids. Both showers peak between December 18 and December 25.

Namesakes
USS Serpens (AK-97) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the constellation.
