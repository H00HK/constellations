Ara  is a southern constellation situated between Scorpius and Triangulum Australe. Its name is Latin for "altar". Ara was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.

Notable features 

Stars 
Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of Scorpius and thus has rich star fields.

  α Ara  is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 242 light-years from Earth.
  β Ara  is an orange-hued supergiant of magnitude 2.8, 600 light-years from Earth.
  γ Ara  is a blue-hued supergiant of magnitude 3.3, 1140 light-years from Earth.
  δ Ara  is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 3.6, 187 light-years from Earth.
  ζ Ara  is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 3.1, 574 light-years from Earth.

The constellation's stars have no names in Western culture, but the Chinese call α Arae "Choo" ("club" or "staff"), and ε Arae "Tso Kang", meaning ' guard'.

Deep-sky objects 
The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the Milky Way and contains several open clusters (notably NGC 6200) and diffuse nebulae (including the b cluster/nebula pair NGC 6188 and NGC 6193). The best of the globular clusters, sixth magnitude NGC 6397, lies at a distance of just , making it one of the closest globular cluster to the solar system.

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two spiral galaxies (NGC 6215 and NGC 6221) are visible near star η Arae.

Open clusters 
NGC 6193 is an open cluster containing approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about half the size of the full Moon. It is approximately 4200 light-years from Earth. It has one b member, a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.9. NGC 6193 is surrounded by NGC 6188, a faint nebula only normally visible in long-exposure photographs.

Globular clusters 
 NGC 6352
 NGC 6362
 NGC 6397 is a globular cluster with an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally dark skies and is normally visible in binoculars. It is a fairly close globular cluster, at a distance of 10,500 light-years.

Planetary Nebulae
The Stingray Nebula (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.

Last, but not least; there is also NGC 6326.  A planetary nebula that might have a binary system at its center.

Illustrations 
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an altar with its smoke 'rising' southward. However, depictions of Ara often vary in their details. In the early days of printing, a 1482 woodcut of Gaius Julius Hyginus's classic  Poeticon Astronomicon  depicts the altar as surrounded by demons.  Johann Bayer in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense; the flames rise southward as in most atlases. Hyginus also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, Willem Blaeu, a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering. Unlike most depictions, the smoke from Blaeu's Ara rises northward, represented by Alpha Arae. A more unusual depiction of Ara comes from Aratus, a Greek uranographer, in 270 BCE. He drew Ara as a lighthouse, where Alpha. Beta, Epsilon, and Zeta Arae represent the base, and Eta Arae represents the flames at the lighthouse's light.

Mythology 
In ancient Greek mythology, Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the Titans. The nearby Milky Way represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar.

Equivalents 
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of the constellation Ara lie within  The Azure Dragon of the East  (東方青龍,  Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng ).

Namesakes 
USS Ara (AK-136) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the constellation.
