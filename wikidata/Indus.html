 Indus  is a constellation in the southern sky. Created in the late sixteenth century, it represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of Asia or the Americas.

Notable features
The constellation Indus as it can be seen by the naked eye.
Indus does not contain any b stars. Alpha Indi is the best star in Indus. It is an orange giant of magnitude 3.1, 101 light-years from Earth. Beta Indi is an orange giant of magnitude 3.7, 600 light-years from Earth. Delta Indi is a white star of magnitude 4.4, 185 light-years from Earth. 

Epsilon Indi is one of the closest stars to Earth, approximately 11.8 light years away. It is an orange dwarf of magnitude 4.7, meaning that the yellow dwarf Sun is slightly hotter and larger. The system has been discovered to contain a pair of binary brown dwarfs, and has long been a prime candidate in SETI studies.

Indus is home to one b binary star. Theta Indi is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, 97 light-years from Earth. Its primary is a white star of magnitude 4.5 and its secondary is a white star of magnitude 7.0.

T Indi is the only b variable star in Indus. It is a semi-regular, deeply coloured red giant with a period of 11 months, 1900 light-years from Earth. Its minimum magnitude is 7 and its maximum magnitude is 5.

History
Indus (top middle) in an extract from Johann Bayer's  Uranometria , its first appearance in a celestial atlas.
The constellation was one of twelve created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's  Uranometria  of 1603. Plancius portrayed the figure as a nude male with arrows in both hands but no bow.
