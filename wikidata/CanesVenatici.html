 Canes Venatici   is one of the 88 official modern constellations.  It is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. Its name is Latin for "hunting dogs", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of Boötes the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.

History
Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius' star atlas. Note that, per the conventions of the time, the image is mirrored.
Canes Venatici can be seen in the orientation they appear to the eyes in this 1825 star chart from  Urania's Mirror .
The stars of Canes Venatici are not b. In classical times, they were included by Ptolemy within the constellation Ursa Major in his star catalogue.  α CVn was Ptolemy's "28th of Ursa Major", and β CVn was his "29th of Ursa Major".

In the medieval times, the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Boötes' stars were traditionally described as representing the club (Greek, Κολλοροβος) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's  Almagest  was translated from Greek to Arabic, the translator Johannitius (following Alberuni) did not know the Greek word and rendered it as the nearest-looking Arabic word, writing العصى ذات الكلاب in ordinary unvowelled Arabic text " al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb ", which means "the spearshaft having a hook". When the Arabic text was translated into Latin, the translator Gerard of Cremona (probably in Spain) mistook the Arabic word كلاب for  kilāb  (the plural of  كلب  kalb ), meaning "dogs", writing  hastile habens canes  ("spearshaft having dogs").
In 1533, the German astronomer Peter Apian depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.
In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer Becvar assigned  Asterion  to β CVn and  Chara  to α CVn.

 Characteristics 
Canes Venatici is bordered by Ursa Major to the north and west, Coma Berenices to the south, and Bootes to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'CVn'. Legend has it that α CVn was ber than usual during the Restoration, as Charles II returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide double star, with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field. 

 β CVn (Chara)  is a yellow-hued main sequence star of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for "joy".

 Y CVn (La Superba)  is a semiregular variable star that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days.  It is a carbon star and is famous for being deep red.

 AM CVn , a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of cataclysmic variable stars, in which the companion star is a white dwarf, rather than a main sequence star. 

 RS CVn  is the prototype of a special class of binary stars of chromospherically active and optically variable components.

Deep-sky objects
Messier 51, the Whirlpool Galaxy taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Canes Venatici contains five Messier objects, including four galaxies. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51, NGC 5194) and NGC 5195, a small barred spiral galaxy that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by Lord Rosse in 1845. It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many star-forming regions and nebulae in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, NGC 5195, that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow. It is passing behind M51 and may be the cause of the larger galaxy's prodigious star formation. NGC 4631 is a barred spiral galaxy, which is one of the largest and best edge-on galaxies in the sky.

M3 (NGC 5272) is a globular cluster 32,000 light-years from Earth.  It is 18' in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is b enough to be seen with binoculars. It can even be seen with the naked eye under particularly dark skies.

M94, also classified as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms and a b core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.
