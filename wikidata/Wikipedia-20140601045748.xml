'''Canes Venatici''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|iː|z|_|v|ɨ|ˈ|n|æ|t|ɨ|s|aɪ}} is one of the 88 official modern [[constellation]]s.  It is a small northern constellation that was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in the 17th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[hunting dog]]s&quot;, and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [[Boötes]] the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.

==History==
[[Image:Canes Venatici.gif|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius' star atlas. Note that, per the conventions of the time, the image is mirrored.]]
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici can be seen in the orientation they appear to the eyes in this 1825 star chart from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.]]
The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were included by [[Ptolemy]] within the constellation [[Ursa Major]] in his [[star catalogue]].  α CVn was Ptolemy's &quot;28th of Ursa Major&quot;, and β CVn was his &quot;29th of Ursa Major&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Boötes' stars were traditionally described as representing the [[Club (weapon)|club]] ([[Greek language|Greek]], Κολλοροβος) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was translated from Greek to [[Arabic]], the translator [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Johannitius]] (following [[Al Biruni|Alberuni]]) did not know the Greek word and rendered it as the nearest-looking Arabic word, writing العصى ذات الكلاب in ordinary unvowelled Arabic text &quot;''al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb''&quot;, which means &quot;the spearshaft having a hook&quot;. When the Arabic text was translated into [[Latin]], the translator [[Gerard of Cremona]] (probably in Spain) mistook the Arabic word كلاب for ''kilāb'' (the plural of  كلب ''kalb''), meaning &quot;dogs&quot;, writing ''hastile habens canes'' (&quot;spearshaft having dogs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1959|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1974|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1990|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1533, the German astronomer [[Peter Apian]] depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.&lt;ref name=apian1&gt;{{Harvnb|Apianus|1533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canesvenatici.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Canes Venatici |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hevelius chose the name ''Asterion'' (from the Greek 'αστέριον, meaning the &quot;little star&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|Smart|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[diminutive]] of 'αστηρ the &quot;star&quot;, or adjective meaning &quot;starry&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the northern dog and ''Chara'' (from the Greek χαρά, meaning &quot;joy&quot;) for the southern dog, as ''Canes Venatici'', the Hunting Dogs, in his [[star atlas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hevelius|1690}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer [[Antonín Bečvář|Becvar]] assigned ''Asterion'' to β CVn and ''Chara'' to α CVn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bečvář|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Canes Venatici is bordered by [[Ursa Major]] to the north and west, [[Coma Berenices]] to the south, and [[Bootes]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CVn'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|12|06.2}} and {{RA|14|07.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between +27.84° and +52.36°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Canes Venatici, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cvn | accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering 465 square degrees, it ranks 38th of the 88 constellations in size.

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Canes Venatici}}

Canes Venatici contains no bright stars, α and β CVn being only of 3rd and 4th [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] respectively. Flamsteed catalogued 25 stars in the constellation, labelling them 1 to 25 Canum Venaticorum, however 1 turned out to be in Ursa Major, 13 was in Coma  Berenices and 22 did not exist.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=366}} 

*'''[[Alpha Canum Venaticorum|α CVn]] (Asterion, Cor Caroli)''' is the constellation's brightest [[star]], named by Sir [[Charles Scarborough]] in memory of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the deposed king of Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to R. H. Allen (''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''), the star was named by Halley for Charles II &quot;at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the king's return to London, May 29, 1660&quot;. According to Deborah J. Warner (''The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800''), it was originally named &quot;Cor Caroli Regis Martyris&quot; (&quot;The Heart of King Charles the Martyr&quot;) for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. (''Burnham's Celestial Handbook'', Volume 1), &quot;the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by [[Johann Elert Bode|J. E. Bode]] at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that α CVn was brighter than usual during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide [[double star]], with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; 

*'''[[Beta Canum Venaticorum|β CVn]] (Chara)''' is a yellow-hued [[main sequence star]] of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for &quot;joy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Y Canum Venaticorum|Y CVn]] (La Superba)''' is a [[semiregular variable star]] that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days.  It is a [[carbon star]] and is famous for being deep red.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[AM Canum Venaticorum|AM CVn]]''', a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of [[cataclysmic variable star]]s, in which the companion star is a [[white dwarf]], rather than a [[main sequence star]]. 

*'''[[RS Canum Venaticorum|RS CVn]]''' is the prototype of a [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|special class of binary stars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad3.u-strasbg.fr/sim-id.pl?protocol=html&amp;Ident=RS+CVn |publisher = SIMBAD  |title = RS CVn -- Variable of RS CVn type |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[chromosphere|chromospherically]] active and optically [[variable star|variable]] components.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Messier51 sRGB.jpg|thumb|[[Messier 51]], the Whirlpool Galaxy taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Canes Venatici contains five [[Messier object]]s, including four [[galaxy|galaxies]]. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] (M51, NGC 5194) and [[NGC 5195]], a small barred [[spiral galaxy]] that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many [[star formation|star-forming regions]] and [[nebula]]e in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, [[NGC 5195]], that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow. It is passing behind M51 and may be the cause of the larger galaxy's prodigious star formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NGC 4631 HST.jpg|thumb|[[NGC 4631]] taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Other notable spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici are the [[Sunflower Galaxy]] (M63, NGC 5055), [[Messier 94|M94]] (NGC 4736), and [[Messier 106|M106]] (NGC 4258). M63, the Sunflower Galaxy, was named for its appearance in large amateur telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 9.0. M94 is a small face-on spiral galaxy with an approximate magnitude of 8.0, about 15 million light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; [[NGC 4631]] is a barred spiral galaxy, which is one of the largest and brightest edge-on galaxies in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, Stephen James: The Caldwell Objects, Sky Publishing Corporation ISBN 0-933346-97-2 page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messier 3|M3]] (NGC 5272) is a [[globular cluster]] 32,000 light-years from Earth.  It is 18' in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is bright enough to be seen with [[binoculars]]. It can even be seen with the naked eye under particularly dark skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

M94, also classified as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms and a bright core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the [[ultraviolet]] because of a ring of [[star formation|new stars]] surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a [[barred spiral galaxy|bar]] that is thus far invisible.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

'''Canis Minor''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|n|ər}} is a small [[constellation]] in the [[Celestial sphere|northern celestial hemisphere]]. In the second century, it was included as an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], or pattern, of two stars in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the [[List of constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;lesser dog&quot; in contrast to [[Canis Major]], the &quot;greater dog&quot;; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter.

Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]], [[Procyon]] (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and [[Gomeisa]] (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by [[Johann Bayer]], who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and [[John Flamsteed]], who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-[[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest]]. A yellow-white [[main sequence]] star, it has a [[white dwarf]] [[Binary star|companion]]. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. [[Luyten's Star]] is a ninth-magnitude [[red dwarf]] and the [[Solar System]]'s next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude [[HD 66141]], which has evolved into an orange [[giant star|giant]] towards the end of its [[stellar evolution|life cycle]], was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint [[deep sky objects]] within the constellation's borders. The 11 [[Canis-Minorids]] are a [[meteor shower]] that can be seen in early December.

== History and mythology ==
[[File:Cmi.jpg|thumb|left|Canis Minor, as depicted by [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] in his 1801 work ''Uranographia'']]
Though strongly associated with the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[celestial cartography|uranographic]] tradition, Canis Minor originates from ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. Procyon and Gomeisa were called ''MASH.TAB.BA'' or &quot;twins&quot; in the ''[[Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', this name was also applied to the pairs of [[Pi3 Orionis|Pi&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Pi4 Orionis|Pi&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Orionis]] and [[Zeta Geminorum|Zeta]] and [[Xi Orionis]]. The meaning of ''MASH.TAB.BA'' evolved as well, becoming the twin deities [[Lulal]] and [[Latarak]], who are on the opposite side of the sky from ''[[Papsukal]]'', the True Shepherd of Heaven in [[Babylonian mythology]]. Canis Minor was also given the name ''DAR.LUGAL'', which translates to &quot;the star which stands behind it&quot;, in the ''MUL.APIN''; the constellation represents a [[rooster]]. This name may have also referred to the constellation [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

Canis Minor was then called ''tarlugallu'' in [[Akkadian astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Astral Magic in Babylonia |page =i–xiii+1–150 [116] |journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series |volume = 85 |issue = 4 |year = 1995 |last = Reiner |first = Erica |jstor = 1006642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canis Minor was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in his second-century [[Almagest]], in which it was defined as a specific pattern ([[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]) of stars; Ptolemy identified only two stars and hence no depiction was possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]]s called the constellation προκυων/''Procyon'', &quot;coming before the dog&quot;, transliterated into [[Latin]] as ''Antecanis'', ''Praecanis'', or variations thereof, by Cicero and others. Roman writers also appended the descriptors ''parvus'', ''minor'' or ''minusculus'' (&quot;small&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot;, for its faintness), ''septentrionalis'' (&quot;northerly&quot;, for its position in relation to Canis Major), ''primus'' (rising &quot;first&quot;) or ''sinister'' (rising to the &quot;left&quot;) to its name ''Canis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Allen | first=Richard Hinckley | year=1963 | origyear=1899 | title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning | edition=corrected | publisher=Dover Publications | location=Mineola, New York | isbn = 978-0-486-21079-7 | page=383 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_GUDis0bETgC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[Greek mythology]], Canis Minor was sometimes connected with the [[Teumessian fox|Teumessian Fox]], a beast turned into stone with its hunter, [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], by [[Zeus]], who placed them in heaven as Canis Major (Laelaps) and Canis Minor (Teumessian Fox).&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3,192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yMbzhPrIkt4C&amp;pg=PA275 |title = Nature Guide Stars and Planets |page = 275 |author = DK Publishing |publisher = Penguin |year = 2012 |isbn = 978-1-4654-0353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eratosthenes]] accompanied the Little Dog with Orion, while [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] linked the constellation with [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], a dog owned by [[Icarius#Icarius of Athens|Icarius of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klepešta|first=Josef|author2=Rükl, Antonín|title=Constellations|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London, England|year=1974|origyear=1969|pages=118–19 | isbn = 978-0-600-00893-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath star tales&quot;/&gt; On discovering the latter's death, the dog and Icarius' daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] took their lives and all three were placed in the sky—Erigone as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] and Icarius as [[Boötes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath star tales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canisminor.htm |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |title = Canis Minor | accessdate = 26 May 2012 |work = Star Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for his faithfulness, the dog was placed along the &quot;banks&quot; of the Milky Way, which the ancients believed to be a heavenly river, where he would never suffer from thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1982) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 126 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Arabic astronomers]] maintained the depiction of Canis Minor (''al-Kalb al-Asghar'' in [[Arabic]]) as a dog; in his [[Book of the Fixed Stars]], [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] included a diagram of the constellation with a canine figure superimposed.&lt;ref name=upton&gt;{{cite journal |pages =  179–197 [195–96] |title = A Manuscript of &quot;The Book of the Fixed Stars&quot; by ʿAbd Ar-Raḥmān Aṣ-Ṣūfī |first = Joseph M. |last = Upton |journal = Metropolitan Museum Studies |volume = 4 |issue = 2 |date = March 1933 |publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | jstor = 1522800 |doi =  10.2307/1522800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages =  1–26 [Plate 12] |first = Emmy |last = Wellesz |title = An Early al-Ṣūfī Manuscript in the Bodleian Library in Oxford: A Study in Islamic Constellation Images |journal = Ars Orientalis |year = 1959 |volume = 3 |jstor = 4629096 |publisher = Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one slight difference between the Ptolemaic vision of Canis Minor and the Arabic; al-Sufi claims [[Mirzam]], now assigned to [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], as part of both Canis Minor—the collar of the dog—and its modern home. The Arabic names for both Procyon and Gomeisa alluded to their proximity and resemblance to Sirius, though they were not direct translations of the Greek; Procyon was called ''ash-Shi'ra ash-Shamiya'', the &quot;Syrian Sirius&quot; and Gomeisa was called ''ash-Shira al-Ghamisa'', the Sirius with bleary eyes.&lt;ref name=upton/&gt; Among the [[Merazig]] of [[Tunisia]], shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called ''Merzem'', includes the stars of Canis Minor and Canis Major and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = La Ricerca Folklorica |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians thought of this constellation as [[Anubis]], the jackal god.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative names have been proposed: [[Johann Bayer]] in the early 17th century termed the constellation ''Fovea'' &quot;The Pit&quot;, and ''Morus'' &quot;[[Sycamine]] Tree&quot;. Seventeenth-century German poet and author [[Philipp von Zesen|Philippus Caesius]] linked it to the dog of Tobias from the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt; [[Richard A.

=== In non-Western astronomy ===

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars corresponding to Canis Minor lie in the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermilion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''). Procyon, Gomeisa and Eta Canis Minoris form an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as Nánhé, the Southern River.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath star tales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} {{cite web |author1 = 陳冠中 |author2 = 陳輝樺 |url = http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060716.html |publisher = AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) |title = 天文教育資訊網 |date = 16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its counterpart, the Northern River Beihe ([[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]]), Nánhé was also associated with a gate or sentry. Along with [[Zeta Cancri|Zeta]] and [[8 Cancri]], [[6 Canis Minoris]] and [[11 Canis Minoris]] formed the asterism ''Shuiwei'', which literally means &quot;water level&quot;. Combined with additional stars in [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], Shuiwei represented an official who managed floodwaters or a marker of the water level.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath star tales&quot;/&gt; Neighboring Korea recognized four stars in Canis Minor as part of a different constellation, &quot;the position of the water&quot;.

[[Polynesian people]]s often did not recognize Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]] it was known as ''Hiro'', meaning &quot;twist as a thread of coconut fiber&quot;, and ''Kopu-nui-o-Hiro'' (&quot;great paunch of Hiro&quot;), which was either a name for the modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included ''Vena'' (after a [[goddess]]), on [[Mangaia]] and ''Puanga-hori'' (false ''Puanga'', the name for [[Rigel]]), in [[New Zealand]]. In the [[Society Islands]], Procyon was called ''Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava'', literally &quot;Aster the priestess of brave heart&quot;, figuratively the &quot;pillar for elocution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Makemson | first = Maud Worcester | year = 1941 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | title = The Morning Star Rises: An Account of Polynesian Astronomy | ref = harv | pages = 199, 209, 247, 267, 280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Tahitian Astronomy: Birth of the Heavenly Bodies |last = Henry |first = Teuira |journal = The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume = 16 |issue = 2 |pages= 101–04 |date = June 1907 | jstor = 20700813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wardaman people]] of the [[Northern Territory]] in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names ''Magum'' and ''Gurumana'', describing them as humans who were transformed into [[Eucalyptus|gum trees]] in the [[dreamtime]].

'''Centaurus''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|ɔr|ə|s}} is a bright constellation in the [[celestial sphere|southern sky]]. [[list of constellations by area|One of the largest]] constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In [[Greek mythology]], Centaurus represents a [[centaur]]; a creature that is half man, half horse. (Another constellation named after a centaur is one from the [[zodiac]]: [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].) Notable stars include [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star system to our own Solar System, its neighbour in the sky, [[Beta Centauri]], and [[V766 Centauri]] one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains [[Omega Centauri]], the brightest [[globular cluster]] as visible from Earth and one of the largest known.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
Centaurus contains several very bright stars because of its position in the [[Milky Way]]; in addition, its alpha and beta stars are used to find the constellation [[Crux]]. The constellation has 281 stars above magnitude 6.5, meaning that they are visible to the unaided eye, the most of any constellation. [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star to the Sun, has a high [[proper motion]]; it will be a mere half-degree from [[Beta Centauri]] in approximately 4000 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

[[Alpha Centauri]] is a [[triple star system]] that contains [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star to the Sun. Traditionally called Rigil Kentaurus or Toliman, meaning &quot;foot of the centaur&quot;, the system has an overall magnitude of -0.28 and is 4.4 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary are both yellow-hued stars; the primary, is of magnitude -0.01 and the secondary is of magnitude 1.35. Proxima, the tertiary star, is a [[red dwarf]] of magnitude 11.0; it is almost 2 degrees away from the primary and secondary and has a period of approximately one million years. Also a [[flare star]], Proxima has minutes-long outbursts where it brightens by over a magnitude. The primary and secondary have a period of 80 years and will be closest to each other as seen from Earth in 2037 and 2038.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

In addition to Alpha Centauri (the [[list of brightest stars|3rd brightest star]] in the sky), a second [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] star, Beta Centauri, is part of Centaurus. Also called Hadar and Agena, Beta Centauri is a double star; the primary is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 0.6, 525 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 4.0 and has a very small separation. A bright [[binary star]] in Centaurus is [[Gamma Centauri]], which appears to the naked eye at magnitude 2.2. The primary and secondary are both blue-white hued stars of magnitude 2.9; their period is 85 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

Centaurus also has many dimmer double stars and binary stars. [[3 Centauri]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 4.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.1. The primary is 298 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

Centaurus is home to many [[variable stars]]. [[R Centauri]] is a [[Mira variable]] star with a minimum magnitude of 11.8 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3; it is 2100 light-years from Earth and has a period of 18 months.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}} [[V810 Centauri]] is a [[semiregular variable]].

[[BPM 37093]] is a [[white dwarf]] star whose [[carbon]] atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since [[diamond]] also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star &quot;Lucy&quot; after the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.asp?newsID=993|title=Discovery of largest known diamond|date=February 15, 2004|work=AZoM|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===

[[Omega Centauri|ω Centauri]] (NGC 5139), despite being listed as the constellation's &quot;omega&quot; star, is in fact a naked-eye [[globular cluster]], located at a distance of 17,000 light-years with a diameter of 150 light-years. It is the largest and brightest globular cluster in the [[Milky Way]], at ten times the size of the next-largest cluster,&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; it has a magnitude of 3.7. It is also the most [[luminosity|luminous]] globular cluster in the Milky Way, at over one million [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}  Omega Centauri is classified as a Shapley class VIII cluster, which means that its center is loosely concentrated. It is also the only globular cluster to be designated with a [[Bayer letter]]; the globular cluster [[47 Tucanae]] is the only one designated with a [[Flamsteed number]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=161}} It contains several million stars, most of which are [[yellow dwarf]] stars, but also possesses [[red giant]]s and [[B-type star|blue-white]] stars; the stars have an average age of 12 billion years. This has prompted suspicion that Omega Centauri was the [[Galactic Center|core]] of a [[dwarf galaxy]] that had been [[galactic merger|absorbed]] by the Milky Way. Omega Centauri was determined to be nonstellar in 1677 by the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; though it was visible as a star to the ancients. Its status as a globular cluster was determined by [[James Dunlop]] in 1827.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=163}} To the unaided eye, Omega Centauri appears fuzzy and is obviously non-circular; it is approximately half a degree in diameter, the same size as the full Moon.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

Centaurus is also home to open clusters. [[NGC 3766]] is an open cluster 6300 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye. It contains approximately 100 stars, the brightest of which are 7th magnitude. [[NGC 5460]] is another naked-eye open cluster, 2500 light-years from Earth, that has an overall magnitude of 6 and contains approximately 40 stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

There is one bright [[planetary nebula]] in Centaurus, [[NGC 3918]], also known as the Blue Planetary. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and a central star of magnitude 11.0; it is 2600 light-years from Earth. The Blue Planetary was discovered by [[John Herschel]] and named for its color's similarity to [[Uranus]], though the nebula is three times larger than the planet.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

Centaurus is rich in galaxies as well. [[NGC 4622]] is a face-on [[spiral galaxy]] located 200 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0146). Its [[spiral arms]] wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a [[galaxy merger|collision]] with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; [[NGC 5253]], a peculiar [[irregular galaxy]], is located near the border with Hydra and [[Messier 83|M83]], with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1-2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxy's high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}} NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as [[binoculars]] under good conditions; it has been described as &quot;shaped like a candle flame&quot;, being long and thin (16' by 3'). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is [[NGC 5102]], found by star-hopping from [[Iota Centauri]]. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}}

One of the closest [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] to Earth is the [[Centaurus A]] galaxy, NGC 5128, at a distance of 11 million light-years (redshift 0.00183). It has a [[supermassive black hole]] at its core, which expels massive jets of matter that emit [[radio wave]]s due to [[synchrotron radiation]]. Astronomers posit that its dust lanes, not common in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], are due to a previous [[galaxy merger|merger]] with another galaxy,&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; probably a [[spiral galaxy]]. NGC 5128 appears in the [[optical spectrum]] as a fairly large elliptical galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]]. Its overall magnitude is 7.0, {{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}} and it has been seen under perfect conditions with the naked eye, making it one of the most distant objects visible to the unaided observer. In equatorial and southern latitudes, it is easily found by [[star hopping]] from Omega Centauri. In small telescopes, the dust lane is not visible; it begins to appear with about 4 inches of aperture under good conditions. In large amateur instruments, above about 12 inches in aperture, the dust lane's west-northwest to east-southeast direction is easily discerned. Another dim dust lane on the east side of the 12 arcminute by 15 arcminute galaxy is also visible.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}}  [[ESO 270-17]], also called the Fourcade-Figueroa Object, is a low-surface brightness object believed to be the remnants of a galaxy; it does not have a core and is very difficult to observe with an amateur telescope. It measures 7 arcminutes by 1 arcminute.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}} It likely originated as a spiral galaxy and underwent a catastrophic gravitational interaction with Centaurus A around 500 million years ago, stopping its rotation and destroying its structure.{{sfn|Steinicke|2007|p=182}}

[[NGC 4650A]] is a [[polar-ring galaxy]] located at a distance of 136 million light years from Earth (redshift 0.01). It has a central core made of older stars that resembles an [[elliptical galaxy]], and an outer ring of young stars that orbits around the core. The plane of the outer ring is distorted, which suggests that NGC 4650A is the result of a [[galaxy collision]] about a billion years ago. This galaxy has also been cited in studies of [[dark matter]], because the stars in the outer ring orbit too quickly for their collective mass. This suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a [[dark matter halo]], which provides the necessary mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the closest [[galaxy cluster]]s to Earth is the [[Centaurus Cluster]], located at a distance of 160 million [[light-years]] ([[redshift]] 0.0114). It has a cooler, denser central region of gas and a hotter, more diffuse outer region. The [[intracluster medium]] in the Centaurus Cluster has a high concentration of metals (elements heavier than helium) due to a large number of [[supernova]]e. This cluster also possesses a plume of gas whose origin is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

==History==
While Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. [[Precession (astronomy)|Precession]] has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern [[declination]]. Thousands of years from now Centaurus will, once again, be at lower latitudes and be visible worldwide.

The figure of Centaurus can be traced back to a Babylonian constellation known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was depicted in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the rear legs and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 57ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks depicted the constellation as a [[centaur]] and gave it its current name. It was mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in the 4th century BCE and [[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BCE. In the 2nd century AD, [[Claudius Ptolemy]] catalogued 37 stars in Centaurus. Large as it is now, in earlier times it was even larger, as the constellation [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]] was treated as an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within Centaurus, portrayed in illustrations as an unspecified animal either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The [[Crux|Southern Cross]], which is now regarded as a separate constellation, was treated by the ancients as a mere asterism formed of the stars composing the centaur's legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] was treated as undefined stars under the centaur's front hooves.

According to the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (''Fasti'' v.379), the constellation honors the centaur [[Chiron]],{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}} who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including [[Heracles]] (Hercules), Theseus, and [[Jason]], the leader of the Argonauts. However, most authorities consider [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to be the civilized Chiron, while Centaurus represents a more uncouth member of the species.&lt;ref name=Sagittarius&gt;Sagittarius - &quot;[http://www.stellardays.com/Signs/Sagittarius.aspx The Archer].&quot; Retrieved on September 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gergard Fasching, ''Sternbilder und ihre Myten'', Springer, 1994 ISBN 3-211-82552-5, page 171&lt;/ref&gt; The legend associated with Chiron says that he was accidentally poisoned with an arrow shot by Hercules, and was subsequently placed in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=108-111}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Centaurus are found in three areas: the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng''), the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''), and the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu''). Not all of the stars of Centaurus can be seen from China, and the unseen stars were classified among the Southern Asterisms by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on his study of western star charts. However, most of the brightest stars of Centaurus, including [[Alpha Centauri|α Cen]], [[Theta Centauri|θ Cen]], [[Epsilon Centauri|ε Cen]] and [[Eta Centauri|η Cen]], can be seen in the Chinese sky.

Some [[Polynesian people]]s considered the stars of Centaurus to be a constellation as well. On [[Pukapuka]], Centaurus had two names: ''Na Mata-o-te-tokolua'' and ''Na Lua-mata-o-Wua-ma-Velo''. In [[Tonga]], the constellation was called by four different names: ''O-nga-tangata'', ''Tautanga-ufi'', ''Mamangi-Halahu'', and ''Mau-kuo-mau''. Alpha and Beta Centauri were not named specifically by the people of Pukapuka or Tonga, but they were named by the people of [[Hawaii]] and the [[Tuamotus]]. In Hawaii, the name for Alpha Centauri was either ''Melemele'' or ''Ka Maile-hope'' and the name for Beta Centauri was either ''Polapola'' or ''Ka Maile-mua''. In the Tuamotu islands, Alpha was called ''Na Kuhi'' and Beta was called ''Tere''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

==Namesakes==
Two [[United States navy]] ships, [[USS Centaurus (AKA-17)]] and [[USS Centaurus (AK-264)]], are named after the constellation.

[[The Centaurus]] is a Mega Mall and commercial/residential complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. Construction started in 2005 and the three 41-storey towers, the tallest structures in Islamabad, were completed by late 2012. The shopping mall was officially opened on February 17, 2013. The Centaurus originally included a 7 star hotel, construction of which is yet to begin.

'''Coma Berenices''' is a traditional [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that has since been defined as one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s. It is located near [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], to which it formerly belonged, and accommodates the [[North Galactic Pole]]. Its name means &quot;Berenice's Hair&quot; (in [[Greek language|Greek]], via [[Latin]]), and refers to the legend of Queen [[Berenice II of Egypt]], who sacrificed her long hair.

== History and mythology ==
Coma Berenices is one of the few constellations to owe its name to a historical figure, in this case Queen [[Berenice II of Egypt]], wife of  [[Ptolemy III of Egypt|Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (''fl.'' 246 BC–221 BC), the king under whom [[Alexandria]] became an important cultural center.

In 243 BC, during the [[Third Syrian War]], Ptolemy undertook a dangerous expedition against the [[Seleucids]], who had murdered his sister. His newlywed bride, Berenice, swore to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] to sacrifice her long, blonde hair, of which she was extremely proud, if her husband returned safely. He did, so she cut her hair and placed it in the goddess's temple. By the next morning the hair had disappeared. To appease the furious king the court astronomer, [[Conon of Samos|Conon]], announced that the offering had so pleased the goddess that she had placed it in the sky. He indicated a cluster of stars that have since been called Berenice's Hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronomica&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] |title = Astronomica |section = 2.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident inspired the court poet [[Callimachus|Callimachus of Cyrene]] to write a poem entitled Βερενίκης πλόκαμος (Greek &quot;Berenice's braid&quot;). About 2/3 of the Greek original is now lost, but the full version was translated to Latin by the Roman poet [[Catullus]], and his version exists to this day.

Coma Berenices consists of a number of stars close together, and has been recognized as a distinct [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] since the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = Stars and Planets |last = Pasachoff |first = Jay M. |year = 2006 |publisher = Houghton Mifflin |location = Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eratosthenes]] referred to it as both &quot;[[Ariadne]]'s Hair&quot; and &quot;Berenice's Hair&quot;.  [[Ptolemy]] referred to it as &quot;the lock&quot; of hair; however, he did not list it as one of his 48 constellations, considering it to be a part of Leo,&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;/&gt; specifically, the [[tuft]] at the end of the lion's tail.

[[Tycho Brahe]], who is usually given credit for Coma's promotion to constellation status, listed it in his star catalogue of 1602,&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;/&gt; but it originally occurred on a celestial globe by the cartographer Caspar Vopel from 1536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/comaberenices.htm |title = Coma Berenices |first = Ian |last = Ridpath |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary%2DDavid%2DThompson/page9m.html |title = An Outline Sketch of  the Origin and History of Constellations and Star-Names |first = Gary D. |last = Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=GLB0095 |title = Celestial table globe (GLB0095)|publisher = National Maritime Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerardus Mercator]] has also been credited as its promoter in 1551.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}} Coma Berenices and the now-defunct constellation [[Antinous_(constellation)|Antinous]] are considered to be the first post-Ptolemaic constellations to be depicted on a celestial globe.&lt;ref&gt;John Lankford (2011) History of Astronomy: An Encyclopedia, p. 165 (ISBN 0-8153-0322-X).&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, and during the 17th century, a few other maps that were made of the sky followed suit.

[[Image:ComaBerenicesCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Coma Berenices as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
[[File:NGC 4565 HST.jpeg|thumb|[[NGC 4565]] has been nicknamed the Needle Galaxy because, when seen in full, it appears as a very narrow streak of light on the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Galactic Disc, Edge-on and Up Close|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1228a/|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ]]

Although Coma Berenices is not a large constellation, it contains eight [[Messier object]]s.  The constellation is rich in [[galaxy|galaxies]], containing the northern part of the [[Virgo cluster]].  There are also several [[globular cluster]]s to be seen.  These objects can be seen with minimal obscuration from dust because the constellation is not in the direction of the galactic plane.  However, because of this fact, there are few [[open cluster]]s (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse [[nebula]]e, or [[planetary nebula]]e.

=== Stars ===
Coma Berenices is not particularly bright, having no stars brighter than fourth magnitude.  [[Beta Comae Berenices]] is the brightest [[star]] in the constellation, at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.2; it is 30 light-years from Earth.  Like the Sun, it is a yellow-hued [[main-sequence star]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}} It is intrinsically only slightly brighter than the [[Sun]], which gives an idea of how faint the Sun would appear seen from Beta Comae's distance.

The second brightest star in Coma Berenices is [[Alpha Comae Berenices|α Comae Berenices]] also called [[Diadem]]. The name represents the gem in Berenice's crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;/&gt; It is a [[binary star]], with two components of almost equal magnitude. To the naked eye, it appears to be one star of magnitude 4.3.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}} Because the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] is so close to the Earth's line of sight, it was long suspected of being an [[eclipsing binary]], but it now appears that the orbital tilt is 0.1° relative to the line of sight, so the stars do not eclipse each other as seen from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Burnham, Robert Jr.|title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook: An Observer's Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System, v.2|publisher=General Publishing Company, Ltd., Toronto|year=1966, 1978|isbn=0-486-23567-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two components are slightly yellow-tinged; both are of magnitude 5.1. This binary has a period of 26 years and is 47 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

[[Image:Coma Berenices photograph.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Photograph of Coma Berenices.]]
[[Gamma Comae Berenices]], which is superimposed on the [[Coma Star Cluster]], is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.4, 170 light-years from Earth. 

There are two other prominent multiple stars in Coma Berenices. [[35 Comae Berenices]] is a [[binary star]] with an optical companion. The two physically related components have a period of 360 years and are 324 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 5.1 and the secondary is a white-hued star of magnitude 7.2. The optical tertiary component is of magnitude 9. [[24 Comae Berenices]] is a [[double star]] with contrasting colors. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.0, 610 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

Over 200 variable stars are known in Coma Berenices, although many of them are obscure.  [[FK Comae Berenices]], which varies between 8.14&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and 8.33&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; over a period of 2.4 days, is the prototype for the [[FK Comae Berenices variable|FK Com class]] of variable stars.  It is believed that the variability of FK Com stars is caused by large, cool spots on the rotating surfaces of the stars.&lt;!-- The preceding is not covered by Ridpath &amp; Tirion 2001 --&gt; [[FS Comae Berenices]] is a [[semi-regular variable]], a [[red giant]] with a minimum magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3. It has a period of approximately 2 months and is 572 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

[[Richard Hinckley Allen]] lists among others the following star names for stars in Coma:&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Coma_Berenices*.html Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning, by Richard Hinckley Allen]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Star clusters ===

==== Coma Berenices Open Cluster ====
{{Main|Coma star cluster}}
The Coma Berenices Cluster does not have a Messier or an NGC designation, but it is in the [[Melotte catalogue]] of open clusters, where it is designated Melotte 111. It is a large, diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars that range between 5th and 10th magnitudes, including several of the naked eye stars in the constellation. [[12 Comae Berenices]], at magnitude 4.8, is the cluster's brightest member. The cluster is spread over a huge region, more than 5 degrees across, near γ Coma Berenices.  The cluster has such a large apparent size because it is relatively nearby, only 288 [[light year]]s away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

==== Globular clusters ====
[[Messier 53|M53]] (NGC 5024) is a globular cluster that was discovered by [[Johann Elert Bode]] in 1775 and independently by [[Charles Messier]] in February 1777.&lt;!-- not cited to Levy --&gt;  it is of magnitude 7.7 and is 56,000 light-years from Earth. M53 is a Shapley class V cluster, indicating that it has intermediate concentration towards its center. Only 1° away is [[NGC 5053]],{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=159-160}} a globular cluster that is sparser and has a less dense nucleus of stars.  Its total luminosity is around 16,000 suns, which is one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster.  It was discovered by [[Sir William Herschel]] in 1784.  It is around magnitude 9.9 m.  [[NGC 4147]] is a somewhat dimmer (magnitude 10.2m) globular cluster with a much smaller apparent size.

=== Galaxies ===

==== Virgo cluster of galaxies ====
{{Main|Virgo Cluster}}
Coma Berenices contains the northern portion of the Virgo cluster (also known as the Coma-Virgo cluster), which is around 60 million light years away.

[[Messier 100|M100]] (NGC 4321) is a 9th-magnitude [[spiral galaxy]] seen face-on. It is part of the Virgo Cluster.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}  At 7 arcminutes across, it has the largest apparent size of any galaxy in the Virgo cluster.   Its diameter is over 120,000 light years, making it among the largest spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster.  Photographs reveal a brilliant core, two prominent spiral arms and an array of secondary ones, as well as several dust lanes.

[[Messier 85|M85]] (NGC 4382) is an [[elliptical galaxy]] in the Virgo cluster. It is one of the brighter members of the cluster at magnitude 9. Its nucleus is bright and appears starlike in small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

[[Messier 98|M98]] (NGC 4192) is a bright, elongated spiral galaxy that is seen nearly edge-on; it can appear elliptical because of its unusual angle. It is of the 10th magnitude and is a member of the Virgo Cluster.

[[Messier 99|M99]] (NGC 4254) is a [[spiral galaxy]] seen face-on. Like M98, it is a 10th-magnitude member of the Virgo Cluster. R.H. Allen called it the &quot;Pinwheel nebula&quot;, although this name is more often applied to the [[Triangulum Galaxy]].

[[Messier 88|M88]] (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy, seen about 30° from edge-on.

[[Messier 91|M91]] (NGC 4548) is a [[barred spiral galaxy]].

==== Coma cluster of galaxies ====
{{Main|Coma Cluster}}
The Coma cluster of galaxies is to the north of the Virgo cluster.  It lies much further off, however, around 230 to 300 million light years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}  The cluster is quite large, containing 1,000 large galaxies and possibly up to 30,000 smaller ones.  A survey by [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1957 identified 29,951 galaxies in the area that are brighter than 19.0&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.  While some of these may be distant background objects, the total number of galaxies in the cluster is quite large.

Due to the great distance to the cluster, most of the galaxies are only visible in large telescopes.  The brightest members are [[NGC 4889]] and [[NGC 4874]], both of which are of thirteenth magnitude, with most of the other members being of fifteenth magnitude or dimmer.  NGC 4889 is a giant [[elliptical galaxy]], which is also the home of the largest known [[black hole]] at 21 billion solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7376/pdf/nature10636.pdf|title=Two ten-billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of giant elliptical galaxies|last=McConnell|first=Nicholas J.|date=2011-12-08|publisher=Nature|accessdate=2011-12-06|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63jBvENqx|archivedate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coma cluster contains comparatively few [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. [[NGC 4921]] is the brightest among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Other galaxies ====
[[Image:Blackeyegalaxy.jpg|thumb|200px|M64, the Black Eye Galaxy]]
[[Messier 64|M64]] (NGC 4826) is known as the [[Black Eye Galaxy]] because of the prominent dark [[dust lane]] in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. The dust lane is only visible in larger amateur telescopes, though galaxy is easily visible in even the smallest amateur instruments because it is of the 9th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}} Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is relatively nearby, at around 17 million light years away from Earth.  Recent studies have revealed that the [[interstellar gas]] in the outer regions of the galaxy rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one [[satellite galaxy]] had [[galactic merger|collided]] with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been destroyed; it has been completely assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise- rotating regions, there are many new [[nebula]]e and young stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Needle Galaxy 4565.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|[[NGC 4565]], the Needle galaxy]]
[[NGC 4314]] is a face-on [[barred spiral galaxy]] at a distance of 40 million light-years.  It is unique for its region of intense star formation that creates a ring around the nucleus, discovered by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The prodigious star formation began a short 5 million years ago and is in a region with a diameter of only 1,000 light-years. The architecture of the core is further unique because the small ring itself has spiral arms that feed gas into the bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 4565]] is a very well known edge-on spiral galaxy. It is of the 10th magnitude and appears superimposed on the Virgo Cluster, though it is only 20 million light-years from Earth. Like many edge-on spiral galaxies, it has a prominent [[dust lane]] and a central bulge.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=122-124}}

[[NGC 4676]], sometimes called the &quot;Mice&quot; galaxies, is a pair of [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]] at a distance of 300 million light-years from Earth. The progenitor galaxies were both [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]; astronomers estimate that they had their closest approach about 160 million years ago. That close approach caused large regions of [[star formation]] in both galaxies, along with long &quot;tails&quot; of dust, stars, and gas. The two progenitor galaxies are predicted to interact significantly at least one more time before completely merging into a larger, probably [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasars ===
[[Quasar]] PG1247+26° is the brightest quasar visible in Coma Berenices.  As well, [[W Comae|W Com]] was originally identified as a variable star and so given a variable star designation, but later discovered to be a [[BL Lacertae]] object.  It is normally around magnitude 16.5 m, but has been known to reach 12th magnitude.

=== Other ===
Coma Berenices contains the [[North Galactic Pole]], at [[right ascension]] {{RA|12|51|25}} and [[declination]] {{DEC|+27|07|48}} (epoch [[J2000.0]]).

=== Meteor showers ===
The December [[Coma Berenicids]] are a meteor shower that lasts from December through January; it peaks between December 18 and 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Coma Berenices (Chinese astronomy)}}
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Coma Berenices are located in two areas: the [[Supreme Palace enclosure]] (太微垣, ''Tài Wēi Yuán'') and the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').

The asterism of Coma Berenices was recognized by several [[Polynesian people]]s. The people of [[Pukapuka]] likely called it ''Te Yiku-o-te-kiole''; the people of Tonga had three different names. These included ''Fatana-lua'', ''Fata-olunga'' (also ''Fata-lalo), and ''Kapakau-o-Tafahi''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

'''Corona Australis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|ɒ|ˈ|s|t|r|eɪ|l|ɨ|s}} or '''Corona Austrina''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|ɒ|ˈ|s|t|r|aɪ|n|ə}}{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Its Latin name means &quot;[[south]]ern [[crown (headgear)|crown]]&quot;, and it is the southern counterpart of [[Corona Borealis]], the northern crown. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] or [[Centaurus]]. Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a [[rock hyrax]].

Although fainter than its namesake, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alpha]] and [[Beta Coronae Australis]] are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. [[Epsilon Coronae Australis]] is the brightest example of a [[W Ursae Majoris variable]] in the southern sky. Lying alongside the [[Milky Way]], Corona Australis contains one of the closest [[Star formation|star-forming regions]] to our Solar System—a dusty [[dark nebula]] known as the [[Corona Australis Molecular Cloud]], lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars [[R Coronae Australis|R]] and [[TY Coronae Australis]] light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.

== Characteristics ==

Corona Australis is a small constellation bordered by [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the north, [[Scorpius]] to the west, [[Telescopium]] to the south, and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]] to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CrA'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|17|58.3}} and {{RA|19|19.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −36.77° and −45.52°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Corona Australis}} Covering 128 square degrees, Corona Australis [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around the 30th of June{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} and ranks 80th in area.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Only visible at latitudes south of 53° north,{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Corona Australis cannot be seen from the British Isles as it lies too far south,{{refn|name=Moore &amp; Tirion 1997 pp164}} but it can be seen from southern Europe{{refn|name=Moore 2005 p202}} and readily from the southern United States.{{refn|name=Moore 'Stargazing' 2000 p86}}

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Constellation Corona Australis.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Corona Australis as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

While not a bright constellation, Corona Australis is nonetheless distinctive due to its easily identifiable pattern of stars,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} which has been described as horseshoe-{{refn|name=Falkner 2011 p100}} or oval-shaped.{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} Though it has no stars brighter than magnitude 2.4, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5),{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=130}} making it the second-brightest constellation.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|26 August 2010}} [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. [[Mu Coronae Australis]], a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21,{{sfn|SIMBAD Mu Coronae Australis}} was labelled by [[Johann Elert Bode]] and retained by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]], who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=114–115}}

=== Stars ===

{{see also|List of stars in Corona Australis}}

The only star in the constellation to have received a name is [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alfecca Meridiana or Alpha CrA]]. The name combines the [[Arabic]] name of the constellation with the [[Latin]] for &quot;middle&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–173}} In Arabic, ''Alfecca'' means &quot;break&quot;, and refers to the shape of both Corona Australis and Corona Borealis.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} Also called simply &quot;Meridiana&quot;,{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} it is a white [[main sequence]] star located 130 light years away from Earth,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.10 and [[Stellar classification|spectral type]] A2Va.{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Coronae Australis}} A rapidly rotating star, it spins at almost 200&amp;nbsp;km per second at its equator, making a complete revolution in around 14 hours.{{sfn|Royer|Zorec|Gómez|2007|p=463}} Like the star [[Vega]], it has [[Infrared excess|excess infrared radiation]], which indicates it may be ringed by a disk of dust.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} &lt;!-- cites two previous sentences --&gt; It is currently a [[main-sequence star]], but will eventually [[stellar evolution|evolve]] into a [[white dwarf]]; currently, it has a luminosity 31 times greater, and a radius and mass of 2.3 times that of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} [[Beta Coronae Australis]] is an orange [[giant star|giant]] 510 light years from Earth.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} Its spectral type is K0II, and it is of apparent magnitude 4.11.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Coronae Australis}} Since its formation, it has evolved from a [[B-type star]] to a [[K-type star]]. Its [[luminosity class]] places it as a [[bright giant]]; its luminosity is 730 times that of the Sun,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} designating it one of the highest-luminosity K0-type stars visible to the naked eye.{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} 100 million years old, it has a radius of 43 [[solar radius|solar radii]] (R&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;) and a mass of between 4.5 and 5 [[solar mass]]es (M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;). Alpha and Beta are so similar as to be indistinguishable in brightness to the naked eye.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}}

Some of the more prominent double stars include [[Gamma Coronae Australis]]—a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars can be seen as separate with a 100&amp;nbsp;mm aperture telescope;{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} They have a combined visual magnitude of 4.2;{{sfn|SIMBAD LTT 7565}} each component is an F8V [[dwarf star]] with a magnitude of 5.01.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 7226}}{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 7227}} [[Epsilon Coronae Australis]] is an [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary]] belonging to a class of stars known as [[W Ursae Majoris variable]]s. These star systems are known as [[Contact binary|contact binaries]] as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 light years away.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Epsilon Coronae Australis''}} Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+.{{sfn|SIMBAD Epsilon Coronae Australis}} At the southern end of the crown asterism are the stars [[Eta¹ Coronae Australis|Eta¹]] and [[Eta² Coronae Australis]], which form an [[optical double]].{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white.{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} [[Kappa Coronae Australis]] is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 5.7 and 6.3 and are 1700 and 490 light years away respectively.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} Kappa² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white,{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} with a spectral type of B9V,{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6953}} while Kappa¹ is of spectral type A0III.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6952}} Lying 202 light years away, [[Lambda Coronae Australis]] is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1,{{sfn|SIMBAD Lambda Coronae Australis}} while the companion star has a magnitude of 9.7.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} The two components are separated by 29.2 arcseconds at an angle of 214 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}}

[[Zeta Coronae Australis]] is a rapidly rotating main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth. The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum due to its rotation.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Its spectral type is B9V.{{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Coronae Australis}} [[Theta Coronae Australis]] lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4.62.{{sfn|SIMBAD Theta Coronae Australis}} Corona Australis harbours [[RX J1856.5-3754]], an isolated [[neutron star]] that is thought to lie 140 (±40) parsecs, or 460 (±130) light years, away, with a diameter of 14&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfn|Ho Wynn C. G. et al.|2007}} It was once suspected to be a [[Quark star#Strange star|strange star]],{{sfn|Drake, Jeremy J. et al.|2002}} but this has been discounted.{{sfn|Ho Wynn C. G. et al.|2007}}

=== Deep sky objects ===

[[File:R Coronae Australis region.jpg|The R Coronae Australis region imaged with the Wide Field Imager at [[ESO]]'s [[La Silla Observatory]]. According to ESO, &quot;The light blue nebulosity seen in this picture is mostly due to the reflection of starlight off small dust particles.&quot; &quot;A prominent dark lane crosses the image from the centre to the bottom left. Here the visible light emitted by the stars that are forming inside the cloud is completely absorbed by the dust. These objects could only be detected by observing at longer wavelengths, by using a camera that can detect infrared radiation.&quot;|right|thumb|300px]]

In the north of the constellation is the [[Corona Australis Molecular Cloud]], a dark [[molecular cloud]] with many embedded [[reflection nebula]]e,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} including [[NGC 6729]], [[NGC 6726]]–7, and [[IC 4812]].{{sfn|Malin|2010}} A [[star formation|star-forming region]] of around 7000 M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} it contains [[Herbig–Haro object]]s ([[protostar]]s) and some very young stars.{{sfn|Malin|2010}} About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, it is one of the closest star-forming regions to our solar system.{{sfn|Reipurth|2008|p=735}} The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by [[Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt]] in 1865.{{sfn|Steinicke|2010|p=176}}

[[R Coronae Australis]] is an irregular variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} Blue-white, it is of spectral type B5IIIpe.{{sfn|SIMBAD R Coronae Australis}} A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material.{{sfn|Malin|2010}} It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} The nebula is often compared to a [[comet]] for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|25 June 2009}} [[S Coronae Australis]] is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a [[T Tauri star]].{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Nearby, another young variable star, [[TY Coronae Australis]], illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4,and the brightness of the nebula varies with it.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e.{{sfn|SIMBAD TY Coronae Australis}} The largest young stars in the region, R, S, [[T|T Coronae Australis]], TY and [[VV Coronae Australis]], are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby.{{sfn|Wang|Mundt|Henning|Apai|2004}} Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the [[globular cluster]] known as [[NGC 6723]], which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.{{refn|name=Coe 2007 p105}}

Near Epsilon and Gamma Coronae Australis is [[Bernes 157]], a [[dark nebula]] and star forming region. It is a large nebula, 55 by 18 arcminutes, that possesses several stars around magnitude 13. These stars have been dimmed by up to 8 magnitudes by its dust clouds.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=266}}

[[IC 1297]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of apparent magnitude 10.7, which appears as a green-hued roundish object in higher-powered amateur instruments.{{refn|name=Griffiths 2012 p132}} The nebula surrounds the variable star RU Coronae Australis, which has an average apparent magnitude of 12.9{{sfn|Moore, ''Data Book''|2000|pp=367–368}} and is a WC class [[Wolf–Rayet star]].{{sfn|SIMBAD RU Coronae Australis}} IC 1297 is small, at only 7 arcseconds in diameter; it has been described as &quot;a square with rounded edges&quot; in the eyepiece, elongated in the north-south direction.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=270}} Descriptions of its color encompass blue, blue-tinged green, and green-tinged blue.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=270}}

Corona Australis' location near the Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. [[NGC 6768]] is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It is made up of two galaxies merging,{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} one of which is an elongated [[elliptical galaxy]] of classification E4 and the other a [[lenticular galaxy]] of classification S0.{{sfn|NASA/IPAC NGC 6768}} [[IC 4808]] is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of [[Beta Sagittarii]]. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|18 August 2011}}

Southeast of Theta and southwest of Eta lies the [[open cluster]] [[ESO 281-SC24]], which is composed of the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars.{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and [[Theta Scorpii]] is the dense globular cluster [[NGC 6541]]. Described as between magnitude 6.3{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} and magnitude 6.6,{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} it is visible in binoculars and small telescopes. Around 22000 light years away, it is around 100 light years in diameter.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} It is estimated to be around 14 billion years old.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2011 p322}} NGC 6541 appears 13.1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments; a 12-inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|5 July 2012}}

=== Meteor showers ===

The [[Corona Australids]] are a meteor shower that takes place between 14 and 18 March each year, peaking around 16 March.{{refn|name=Sherrod Koed 2003 p50}} This meteor shower does not have a high peak hourly rate. In 1953 and 1956, observers noted a maximum of 6 meteors per hour and 4 meteors per hour respectively; in 1955 the shower was &quot;barely resolved&quot;.{{sfn|Weiss|1957|p=300}} However, in 1992, astronomers detected a peak rate of 45 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Rogers|Keay|1993|p=274}} The Corona Australids' rate varies from year to year.{{sfn|Weiss|1957|p=302}}{{sfn|Ellyett|Keay|1956|p=479}} At only six days, the shower's duration is particularly short,{{sfn|Rogers|Keay|1993|p=274}} and its [[meteoroid]]s are small; the stream is devoid of large meteoroids. The Corona Australids were first seen with the unaided eye in 1935 and first observed with [[radar]] in 1955.{{sfn|Ellyett|Keay|1956|p=479}} Corona Australid meteors have an entry velocity of 45 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Jenniskens|1994|p=1007}} In 2006, a shower originating near Beta Coronae Australis was designated as the Beta Coronae Australids. They appear in May, the same month as a nearby shower known as the May Microscopids, but the two showers have different trajectories and are unlikely to be related.{{sfn|Jopek et al.|2010|p=871–872}}

== History ==

{{see also|Corona Australis (Chinese astronomy)}}
[[File:Cororna Australis.jpg|thumb|right|Corona Australis depicted in the ''[[Atlas Coelestis]]'' of [[John Flamsteed]]]]

Corona Australis may have been recorded by ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns in the [[MUL.APIN]], as a constellation called MA.GUR (&quot;The Bark&quot;). However, this constellation, adjacent to SUHUR.MASH (&quot;The Goat-Fish&quot;, modern [[Capricornus (constellation)|Capricornus]]), may instead have been modern [[Epsilon Sagittarii]]. As a part of the southern sky, MA.GUR was one of the fifteen &quot;stars of [[Ea (god)|Ea]]&quot;.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=19}}

In the 3rd century BC, the Greek [[Didacticism|didactic]] poet [[Aratus]] wrote of, but did not name the constellation,{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=83}} instead calling the two crowns Στεφάνοι (''Stephanoi''). The Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] described the constellation in the 2nd century AD, though with the inclusion of [[Alpha Telescopii]], since transferred to Telescopium.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Corona Australis}} Ascribing 13 stars to the constellation,{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} he named it Στεφάνος νοτιος (''Stephanos notios''), &quot;Southern Wreath&quot;, while other authors associated it with either Sagittarius (having fallen off his head) or Centaurus; with the former, it was called ''Corona Sagittarii''.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}} Similarly, the Romans called Corona Australis the &quot;Golden Crown of Sagittarius&quot;.{{sfn|Simpson|2012|p=148}} It was known as ''Parvum Coelum'' (&quot;Canopy&quot;, &quot;Little Sky&quot;) in the 5th century.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} The 18th-century French astronomer [[Jérôme Lalande]] gave it the names ''Sertum Australe'' (&quot;Southern Garland&quot;){{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} and ''Orbiculus Capitis'', while German poet and author [[Philipp von Zesen|Philippus Caesius]] called it ''Corolla'' (&quot;Little Crown&quot;) or ''Spira Australis'' (&quot;Southern Coil&quot;), and linked it with the Crown of Eternal Life from the New Testament. Seventeenth-century celestial cartographer [[Julius Schiller]] linked it to the Diadem of Solomon.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; Sometimes, Corona Australis was not the wreath of Sagittarius but arrows held in his hand.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}}

Corona Australis has been associated with the myth of [[Dionysis|Bacchus]] and [[Semele|Stimula]]. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] had impregnated Stimula, causing [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to become jealous. Juno convinced Stimula to ask Jupiter to appear in his full splendor, which the mortal woman could not handle, causing her to burn. After Bacchus, Stimula's unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=232–233}}

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corona Australis are located within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}} The constellation itself was known as ''ti'en pieh'' (&quot;Heavenly Turtle&quot;) and during the [[Western Zhou]] period, marked the beginning of winter. However, [[Axial precession|precession]] over time has meant that the &quot;Heavenly River&quot; ([[Milky Way]]) became the more accurate marker to the ancient Chinese and hence supplanted the turtle in this role.{{refn|name=Porter 1996 pp35–36}} Arabic names for Corona Australis include ''Al Ķubbah'' &quot;the Tortoise&quot;, ''Al Ĥibā'' &quot;the Tent&quot; or ''Al Udḥā al Na'ām'' &quot;the Ostrich Nest&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} It was later given the name ''Al Iklīl al Janūbiyyah'', which the European authors [[Edmund Chilmead|Chilmead]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]] and Caesius transliterated as Alachil Elgenubi, Elkleil Elgenubi and Aladil Algenubi respectively.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}

The [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] speaking [[San people]] of South Africa knew the constellation as ''≠nabbe ta !nu'' &quot;house of branches&quot;—owned originally by the Dassie ([[rock hyrax]]), and the star pattern depicting people sitting in a semicircle around a fire.{{sfn|Lloyd|1873}}

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria saw it as ''Won'', a boomerang thrown by ''Totyarguil'' ([[Altair]]).{{sfn|Hamacher|Frew|2010}} The [[Aranda people]] of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth by a group of sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created [[Gosses Bluff crater]], 175&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Alice Springs]].{{sfn|Hamacher|28 March 2011}} The [[Torres Strait Islanders]] saw Corona Australis as part of a larger constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]'s tail; the [[Pleiades]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] were also associated. This constellation was [[Tagai]]'s canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the ''Usiam'', and Orion, called the ''Seg''. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a [[Remora|suckerfish]], while [[Eta Sagittarii]] and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=223–224}} On the island of [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]], the figure of Corona Australis was called ''Tanuma'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Na Kaua-ki-Tonga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

'''Equuleus''' {{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|k|w|uː|l|i|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for 'little horse', a [[foal]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after [[Crux]]), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the [[apparent magnitude|fourth magnitude]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:EquuleusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Equuleus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
The brightest star in Equuleus is [[Alpha Equulei]], traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the section of the horse&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}

There are few [[variable star]]s in Equuleus.  Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint. [[Gamma Equulei]] is an [[alpha CVn star]], ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12½ minutes.&lt;!-- not cited to Ridpath and Tirion 2001 --&gt; It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an [[optical binary|optical companion]] of magnitude 6.1, [[6 Equulei]]. It is divisible in binoculars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[R Equulei]] is a [[Mira variable]] that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days.

Equuleus contains some [[double star]]s of interest.  γ Equ consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 (slightly variable) and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2 [[arcsecond]]s.  [[Epsilon Equulei]] is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[Delta Equulei|δ Equ]] is a [[binary star]] with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary.  The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.

===Deep-sky objects===
Due to its small size and its distance from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Equuleus contains no notable deep sky objects. Some very faint [[galaxy|galaxies]] between magnitudes 13 and 15 include [[NGC 7015]], [[NGC 7040]], [[NGC 7045]] and [[NGC 7046]].

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pegasus and Equuleus (best currently available version - 2014).jpg|thumb|Seen in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris (meaning &quot;swiftness&quot; or &quot;speed&quot;), who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse [[Pegasus]]. Celeris was given to [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from [[Poseidon]]'s trident, during the contest between him and [[Athena]] when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before [[Pegasus]], it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Created by [[Hipparchus]] and included by [[Ptolemy]], it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse it is depicted as a horse's head alone.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}

'''Fornax''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔr|n|æ|k|s}} is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[furnace]]. It was named by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756. Fornax is one of the 88 modern constellations.

==History==
[[File:Sidney_Hall_-_Urania's_Mirror_-_Psalterium_Georgii,_Fluvius_Eridanus,_Cetus,_Officina_Sculptoris,_Fornax_Chemica,_and_Machina_Electrica.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Fornax Chemica can be seen below [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]] in this card from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
De Lacaille originally called the constellation &quot;Fornax Chemica&quot; (the [[chemical]] furnace),{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=148-149}} representing a small [[solid fuel]] vessel used for heating [[chemistry|chemical]] [[experiment]]s.

==Notable features==
[[Image:Constellation Fornax.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The constellation Fornax as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Fornax}}
[[Alpha Fornacis]] is a binary star that can be resolved by small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow-tinged [[main-sequence]] star of magnitude 3.9 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 6.5; the secondary may actually be a [[variable star]]. It has a period of 300 years and is 46 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Fornacis]] is a yellow-hued [[giant star]] of magnitude 4.5, 169 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=148-149}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Fornax has been the target of investigations into the furthest reaches of the [[universe]]. The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] is located within Fornax, and the [[Fornax Cluster]], a small [[cluster of galaxies]], lies primarily within Fornax. At a meeting of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a team from [[University of Queensland]] described 40 unknown &quot;dwarf&quot; galaxies in this constellation; follow-up observations with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the [[European Southern Observatory]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] revealed that [[ultra compact dwarfs]] are much smaller than previously known dwarf galaxies, about {{convert|120|ly|pc}} across.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.129-sep07/messenger-no129-49-52.pdf Hilker M. et. al.], 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 1049]] is a [[globular cluster]] 500,000 light-years from Earth. It is in the [[Fornax Dwarf]] Galaxy.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=176}}

[[UDFj-39546284]], a galaxy which was identified as the most distant object in the universe from Earth as of January 2011, is located in Fornax. It was detected using the Hubble UDF image.

[[HIP 13044 b]] is an [[exoplanet]] in the constellation, reported in November 2010, that was discovered to have originated outside of the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11775803|title='Alien' planet detected circling dying star|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date={{date|2010-11-18}}|accessdate={{date|2010-11-20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 1097]] is a [[barred spiral galaxy]] in Fornax, about 60 million light-years from Earth. At magnitude 9, it is visible in medium amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=148-149}} It is notable as a [[Seyfert galaxy]] with strong spectral emissions indicating ionized gases and a central [[supermassive black hole]].

[[NGC 1365]] is another [[barred spiral galaxy]] located at a distance of 60 million light-years from Earth. Like NGC 1097, it is also a [[Seyfert galaxy]]. Its bar is a center of [[star formation]] and shows extensions of the spiral arms' [[dust lane]]s. The bright nucleus indicates the presence of an [[active galactic nucleus]] - a galaxy with a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center, accreting matter from the bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; It is a 10th magnitude galaxy associated with the [[Fornax Cluster]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=148-149}}

[[NGC 1360]] is a [[planetary nebula]] in Fornax with a magnitude of approximately 9.0, 978 light-years from Earth. Its central star is of magnitude 11.4, an unusually bright specimen. It is five times the size of the famed [[Ring Nebula]] in [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]] at 6.5 arcminutes. Unlike the Ring Nebula, NGC 1360 is clearly elliptical.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=134-135}}

[[Fornax A]] is a [[radio galaxy]] with extensive radio lobes that corresponds to the optical galaxy NGC 1316, a 9th-magnitude galaxy.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=148-149}} One of the closer [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] to Earth at a distance of 80 million light-years, Fornax A appears in the [[optical spectrum]] as a large [[elliptical galaxy]] with [[dust lane]]s near its core. These dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently [[galaxy merger|merged]] with a small [[spiral galaxy]]. Because it has a high rate of [[type Ia supernova]]e, NGC 1316 has been used to determine the size of the universe. The [[astrophysical jet|jet]]s producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful, giving the lobes a more diffuse, knotted structure due to interactions with the [[intergalactic medium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1 = Wilkins |first1 = Jamie |last2 = Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |location = Buffalo, New York |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with this [[peculiar galaxy]] is an entire cluster of galaxies.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=148-149}}

The [[Fornax Dwarf]] galaxy is a [[dwarf galaxy]] that is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is not visible in amateur telescopes, despite its relatively small distance of 500,000 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=148-149}}

'''Leo Minor''' is a small and faint [[constellation]] in the [[Celestial sphere|northern celestial hemisphere]]. Its name is Latin for &quot;the smaller lion&quot;, in contrast to [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable [[Ursa Major]] to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical astronomers; it was designated by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168–69}}

There are 37 stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude&amp;nbsp;4.5. [[46&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], an orange [[giant star|giant]] of magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.8, is located some 95&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s from Earth. At magnitude&amp;nbsp;4.4, [[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is the second brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a [[Bayer designation]]. It is a [[binary star]], the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white [[main sequence]] star. The third brightest star is [[21&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], a rapidly rotating [[A-type main sequence star|white main sequence star]] of average magnitude&amp;nbsp;4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with [[planetary system]]s, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique [[deep-sky object]] [[Hanny's Voorwerp]].

==History==
The classical astronomers [[Aratus]] and [[Ptolemy]] had noted the region of what is now Leo Minor to be undefined and not containing any distinctive pattern; Ptolemy classified the stars in this area as ''amorphōtoi'' (not belonging to a constellation outline) within the constellation Leo.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}}

[[Johannes Hevelius]] first depicted Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his star atlas ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'',{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Filling the remaining gaps}} and included 18 of its objects in the accompanying ''Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum''.{{sfn|Hevelius|1687|pp=214–15}} Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189–90}} In 1845, English astronomer [[Francis Baily]] revised the catalogue of Hevelius's new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as [[Bayer designation]] to stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]] 4.5.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=8}} [[Richard A. Proctor]] gave the constellation the name ''Leaena'' &quot;the Lioness&quot; in 1870,{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}} explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.{{sfn|Proctor|1870|pp=16–17}}

German astronomer [[Christian Ludwig Ideler]] posited that the stars of Leo Minor had been termed ''Al Thibā' wa-Aulāduhā'' &quot;Gazelle with her Young&quot; on a 13th-century Arabic celestial globe, recovered by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] and housed in the prelate's museum at [[Velletri]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;See also Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 158 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Arabist [[Friedrich Wilhelm Lach]] describes a different view, noting that they had been seen as ''Al Haud'' &quot;the Pond&quot;, which the Gazelle jumps into.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}} In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars Beta, 30, 37 and 46 Leonis Minoris made up ''Neiping'', a &quot;Court of Judge or Mediator&quot;, or ''Shi'' &quot;Court Eunuch&quot;{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}} or were combined with stars of the neighbouring Leo to make up a large celestial dragon or State Chariot.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}}&lt;ref&gt;See also Chartrand, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  A line of four stars was known as ''Shaowei''; it represented four Imperial advisors and may have been located in Leo Minor, Leo or adjacent regions.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}}

==Characteristics==
A dark area of the sky with a triangle of brighter stars just visible to the naked eye in good conditions,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} Leo Minor has been described by [[Patrick Moore]] as having &quot;dubious claims to a separate identity&quot;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=103}} It is a small constellation bordered by [[Ursa Major]] to the north, [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] to the west, [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] to the south, and touching the corner of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'LMi'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16&amp;nbsp;[[Edge (geometry)|sides]]. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|9|22.4}} and {{RA|11|06.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 22.84° and 41.43°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Leo Minor}} Ranked 64th out of 88 constellations in size, Leo Minor covers an area of 232.0&amp;nbsp;square degrees, or 0.562&amp;nbsp;percent of the sky.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations – part two}} It [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at midnight on February 24,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} and at 9 p.m. on May 24.{{sfn|The Constellations : Part 2 Culmination Times}}

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Leo Minor}}
There are only three [[star]]s in the constellation brighter than magnitude 4.5,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189–90}} and 37&amp;nbsp;stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations – part two}} Leo Minor does not have a star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168–69}} It is unclear whether he intended to give [[46&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] a Bayer designation, as he recognised Beta and 46&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189–90}}

At magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange [[giant star|giant]] of [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] K0III named 46&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris or Praecipua;{{sfn|SIMBAD 46 Leonis Minoris}} its colour is evident when seen through binoculars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=103}} Situated {{Convert|95|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2}} from Earth,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168–69}} it has around 32&amp;nbsp;times the [[luminosity]] and is 8.5&amp;nbsp;times the size of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Praecipua''}} It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by [[Johann Elert Bode]], which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189–90}} More confusion occurred with its proper name ''Praecipua'', which appears to have been originally applied to [[37 Leonis Minoris]] in the 1814 ''Palermo Catalogue'' of [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minoris—an error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}} The original &quot;Praecipua&quot;, 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69,{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}} but is a distant yellow [[supergiant]] of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of −1.84,{{sfn| Kovtyukh et al.|2010}} around {{Convert|578|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=3}} distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}}

[[File:LeoMinorCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leo Minor as seen by the naked eye]]
[[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is a binary star system. The primary is a giant star of spectral class G8 and apparent magnitude of 4.4. It has around double the mass, 7.8&amp;nbsp;times the radius and is 36&amp;nbsp;times the luminosity of the Earth's Sun. Separated by 11&amp;nbsp;seconds of arc from the primary, the secondary is a [[F-type main-sequence star|yellow-white main sequence star]] of spectral type F8. The two orbit around a common [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|centre of gravity]] every 38.62&amp;nbsp;years,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Leonis Minoris''}} and lie {{Convert|154|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away from the [[Solar System]].{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Leonis Minoris}}

Around {{Convert|98|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away and around 10&amp;nbsp;times as luminous as the Sun, [[21&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] is a rapidly rotating [[A-type main sequence star|white main sequence star]], spinning on its axis in less than 12&amp;nbsp;hours and very likely flattened in shape.{{sfn|Kaler, ''21 Leonis Minoris''}} Of average apparent magnitude 4.5 and spectral type A7V, it is a [[Delta Scuti variable]].{{sfn|SIMBAD 21 Leonis Minoris}} These are short period (six hours at most) [[Variable star#Pulsating variable stars|pulsating]] stars which have been used as [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]] and as subjects to study [[astroseismology]].{{sfn|Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti variables}}
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Leo Major and Leo Minor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Leo Minor above the head of Leo, as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.&amp;nbsp;1825{{sfn|Ridpath, Urania’s Mirror}}]]
Also known as SU and SV Leonis Minoris, [[10&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris|10]] and [[11&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] are yellow giants of spectral type G8III, with average magnitudes 4.54 and 5.34 respectively. Both are [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|RS Canum Venaticorum]] variables,{{sfn|SIMBAD 10 Leonis Minoris}}{{sfn|SIMBAD 11 Leonis Minoris}} with 10&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris varying by 0.012&amp;nbsp;magnitude over 40.4&amp;nbsp;days, and 11&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris by 0.033&amp;nbsp;magnitude over 18&amp;nbsp;days.{{sfn| Skiff|Lockwood|1986}} 11&amp;nbsp;Leonis Minoris has a [[red dwarf]] companion of spectral type M5V and apparent magnitude 13.0.{{sfn|SIMBAD GJ 356 B}}  [[20 Leonis Minoris]] is a multiple star system {{Convert|49|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away from the Sun. The main star is another yellow star, this time a [[G-type main-sequence star|dwarf]] of spectral type G3Va and apparent magnitude 5.4.{{sfn|SIMBAD 20 Leonis Minoris}} The companion is an old, active red dwarf that has a relatively high [[metallicity]] and is of spectral type M6.5. The fact that the secondary star is brighter than expected indicates it is likely two stars very close together that are unable to be made out separately with current viewing technology.{{sfn|Gizis et al.|2000}}

[[R Leonis Minoris|R]] and [[S Leonis Minoris]] are long-period [[Mira variable]]s, while [[U Leonis Minoris]] is a [[Semiregular variable star|semiregular variable]];{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=186–87}} all three are [[red giant]]s of spectral types M6.5e-M9.0e,{{sfn|SIMBAD R Leonis Minoris}} M5e {{sfn|SIMBAD S Leonis Minoris}} and M6 respectively.{{sfn|SIMBAD U Leonis Minoris}} R varies between magnitudes 6.3 and 13.2 during a period of 372&amp;nbsp;days, S varies between magnitudes 8.6 and 13.9 during a period of 234&amp;nbsp;days, and U varies between magnitudes 10.0 and 13.3 during a period of 272&amp;nbsp;days. The lack of bright stars makes finding these objects challenging for amateur astronomers.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=186–87}} [[G117-B15A]], also known as RY Leonis Minoris, is a [[pulsating white dwarf]] of apparent magnitude 15.5.{{sfn|SIMBAD RY Leonis Minoris}} With a period of approximately 215&amp;nbsp;seconds, and losing a second every 8.9&amp;nbsp;million years, the 400&amp;nbsp;million-year-old star has been proposed as the most stable celestial clock.{{sfn|McDonald Observatory}}

[[SX Leonis Minoris]] is a [[dwarf nova]] of the SU Ursae Majoris type that was identified in 1994.{{sfn|Nogami et al.|1997}} It consists of a white dwarf and a donor star, which orbit each other every 97&amp;nbsp;minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an [[accretion disc]] and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64&amp;nbsp;days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet.{{sfn|Wagner et al.|1998}}&lt;!-- cites two previous sentences --&gt; Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, [[RZ Leonis Minoris]], which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.{{sfn|Robertson et al.|1995}}

Two stars with planetary systems have been found. [[HD&amp;nbsp;87883]] is an orange dwarf of magnitude&amp;nbsp;7.57 and spectral type K0V 18&amp;nbsp;parsecs distant from Earth. With a diameter three quarters that of Earth's sun, it is only 31 percent as luminous. It is orbited by a planet around 1.78&amp;nbsp;times the mass of Jupiter every 7.9&amp;nbsp;years, and there are possibly other smaller planets.{{sfn|Fischer et al.|2009}} [[HD 82886]] is a yellow dwarf of spectral type G0 and visual magnitude&amp;nbsp;7.63.{{sfn|SIMBAD HD 82886}} A planet 1.3&amp;nbsp;times the mass of Jupiter and orbiting every 705 days was discovered in 2011.{{sfn|Planet HD 82886 b}}

===Deep-sky objects===
In terms of [[deep-sky object]]s, Leo Minor contains many galaxies viewable in amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Knoxville Observers - Leo Minor}} Located 3&amp;nbsp;degrees southeast of [[38 Leonis Minoris]], [[NGC 3432]] is seen nearly edge on. Known as the knitting needle galaxy, it is of apparent magnitude&amp;nbsp;11.7 and measures 6.8 by 1.4 arcminutes.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} Located 42&amp;nbsp;million light years away, it is moving away from the Solar System at a rate of 616&amp;nbsp;km per second. In 2000, a star within the galaxy brightened to magnitude 17.4, and has since been determined to be a [[luminous blue variable]] and [[supernova imposter]].{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=196}} [[NGC&amp;nbsp;3003]], a SBbc [[barred spiral galaxy]] with an apparent magnitude of 12.3 and an angular size of 5.8&amp;nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcminutes]], is seen almost edge-on.{{sfn|NED NGC 3003}} [[NGC 3344]], 25&amp;nbsp;million light years distant, is face-on towards Earth.{{sfn|galaxy in a spin}} Measuring 7.1 by 6.5&amp;nbsp;arcminutes in size, it has an apparent magnitude of 10.45.{{sfn|NED NGC 3344}}  [[NGC&amp;nbsp;3504]] is a [[starburst galaxy|starburst]] barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude&amp;nbsp;11.67 and measuring 2.1&amp;nbsp;by 2.7&amp;nbsp;arcminutes.{{sfn|NED NGC 3504}} It has hosted supernovae in 1998{{sfn|Garnavich|1998}} and 2001.{{sfn|Matheson et al.|2001}} It and the [[spiral galaxy]] [[NGC&amp;nbsp;3486]] are also almost face-on towards Earth; the latter is of magnitude&amp;nbsp;11.05 and measures 7.1&amp;nbsp;by 5.2&amp;nbsp;arcminutes.{{sfn|NED NGC 3486}} [[NGC&amp;nbsp;2859]] is an SB0-type [[lenticular galaxy]].{{sfn|NED NGC 2859}}

At least two pairs of interacting galaxies have been observed. [[Arp&amp;nbsp;107]] is a pair of galaxies in the process of merging, located 450&amp;nbsp;million light years away.{{sfn|Spitzer Arp 107}} [[NGC&amp;nbsp;3395]] and [[NGC&amp;nbsp;3396]] are a spiral and irregular barred spiral galaxy respectively that are interacting, located 1.33&amp;nbsp;degrees southwest of 46 Leonis Minoris.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|p=180}}

The unique deep-sky object known as [[Hanny's Voorwerp]] was discovered in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the [[Galaxy Zoo]] project. Lying near the 650&amp;nbsp;million light year-distant spiral galaxy [[IC&amp;nbsp;2497]], it is around the same size as the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Hubble Zooms in on a Space Oddity}} It contains a 16,000 light year wide hole.{{sfn|Radio observations shed new light on Hanny's Voorwerp}} The voorwerp is thought to be the visual light echo of a [[quasar]] now gone inactive,{{sfn|Rincon|2008}} possibly as recently as 200,000 years ago.{{sfn|Hubble Zooms in on a Space Oddity}}

===Meteor showers===
Discovered by Dick McCloskey and Annette Posen of the Harvard Meteor Program in 1959,{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=83–84}} the [[Leonis Minorids]] peak between October&amp;nbsp;18 and October&amp;nbsp;29. The shower's parent body is the long period comet [[C/1739 K1 (Zanotti)]].{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}} It is a minor shower, and can only be seen from the Northern Hemisphere.{{sfn|IMO Meteor Shower Calendar 2012}}

'''Microscopium''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|aɪ|k|r|ə|ˈ|s|k|ɒ|p|i|əm}} is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky, defined in the 18th century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its brightest star is [[Gamma Microscopii]] of [[apparent magnitude]] 4.68, actually a yellow giant located around 381 light-years distant. Two star systems—[[WASP-7]] and [[HD 205739]]—have been found to have [[exoplanet|planet]]s, while another—[[AU Microscopii]]—has a [[debris disk]].

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Sagittarius and Corona Australis, Microscopium, and Telescopium.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Seen in the 1824 star chart set ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (in the lower left)]]
The stars that now comprise Microscopium may formerly have belonged to the hind feet of Sagittarius.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rubie (1830) The British Celestial Atlas, p. 37 (ebook available at https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KDEAAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdid=book-KDEAAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdot=1).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is uncertain as, while its stars seem to be referred to by [[Al-Sufi]] as having been seen by [[Ptolemy]], Al-Sufi does not specify their exact positions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ellard Gore, Astronomical Curiosities:Facts and Fallacies (Google e-Book) (ISBN 1465524428, 9781465524423).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name is [[Latin]] for [[microscope]]; it was called this due to its visual similarity to 18th century microscope.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=233}} Its [[star]]s are very faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical [[northern hemisphere]].

The [[former constellations|former constellation]] Neper, representing an [[auger (drill)|auger]], may have been located in or near modern-day Microscopium. However, this connection is disputed.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=233}}

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Constellation Microscopium.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Microscopium as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

Microscopium is a small constellation bordered by [[Capricornus]] to the north, [[Piscis Austrinus]] and [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] to the west, [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the east, [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] to the south, and touching on [[Telescopium]] to the southeast. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Mic'.&lt;ref name=pa30_469&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The new international symbols for the constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 4 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|20|27.3}} and {{RA|21|28.4}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −27.45° and −45.09°.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Microscopium, constellation boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#mic | accessdate=13 July 2012 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude, the constellation is invisible to the naked eye in areas with polluted skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kambič|first=Bojan |title=Viewing the Constellations with Binoculars|publisher=Springer|year=2009|page=341|isbn=0387853545|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=3vxLNPNHOcwC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=Microscopium&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGkDULW-A-eTiAe0zYGBCA&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Microscopium&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==
{{see also|List of stars in Microscopium}}
Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the [[Bayer designation]]s [[Alpha Microscopii|Alpha]] through to [[Iota Microscopii|Iota]] in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi turned out to be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it [[Nu Microscopii]].&lt;ref name=wagman&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, Virginia  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=181, 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brightest star is [[Gamma Microscopii]], which has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.68.

'''Octans''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|k|t|æ|n|z}} is a faint [[constellation]] of the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named after the [[octant (instrument)|octant]], a navigational instrument. The constellation was devised by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in the eighteenth century.

[[Image:Constellation Octans.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Octans as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

Octans is notable as the location of the south [[celestial pole]]. Unlike the north pole, it has no bright [[pole star]]: [[Sigma Octantis]] (σ Oct) is a naked-eye star very close to the pole, but it is so faint (mag. +5.45) that it is practically useless for navigation purposes. Conveniently for navigators, the constellation [[Crux]], the Southern Cross, points toward the pole.

The constellation is circumpolar to the south celestial pole, so it can be seen in [[Southern Hemisphere]] skies during the evening in any month of the year. The [[Right Ascension]] and month of best visibility given are for the three brightest stars, which are at their highest in the sky during the evening in November.

==History and mythology==
Octans was created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1759 out of faint circumpolar stars. Originally, it was known as &quot;Octans Hadleianus&quot; in honor of the octant's inventor, [[John Hadley]], who devised it in 1730. There is no real mythology related to Octans, partially due to its extreme southerly latitude.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=257}}

==Stars==
Octans is a very faint constellation; its brightest star is [[Nu Octantis]], a magnitude 3.8 star. [[Sigma Octantis]], the southern [[pole star]], is a magnitude 5.4 star about 1 degree away from the [[South Celestial Pole]]. Its faintness means that it cannot be used for navigation.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=258}}

==Octans as the name==
{{USS|Octans|AF-26}} was once a [[United States Navy]] ship.

'''Telescopium''' is a minor southern [[constellation]] created in the 18th century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a [[France|French]] [[astronomer]] and student of the southern skies. Its name is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word for [[telescope]]. It was created in honor of the telescope's invention.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=233}}

The brightest star in the constellation is [[Alpha Telescopii]], a blue-white subgiant with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star [[Zeta Telescopii]] at magnitude 4.1.

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Sagittarius and Corona Australis, Microscopium, and Telescopium.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Seen in the 1824 star chart set ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (in the lower right)]]
Telescopium was introduced in 1751-52 by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] with the French name ''le Telescope'', depicting an [[aerial telescope]]. It stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpio.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Telescopium}} [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] called it the ''Astronomische Fernrohr'' in his 1805 ''Gestirne'' and kept its size, but Baily and Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=414}} The much reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became [[Eta Sagittarii]],{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=233}} which it had been before Lacaille placed it in Telescopium,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=300}} Gamma was placed in Scorpio and renamed [[G Scorpii]] by  [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]],{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=300}} Theta Telescopii reverted to its old appellation of [[45 Ophiuchi|d Ophiuchi]],{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=300}} and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially unnamed, it is now known as HR 6875.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=300}}

Telescopium was periodically called &quot;Tubus Astronomicus&quot;; this name is now deprecated.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=233}}

== Characteristics ==
A small constellation, Telescopium is bordered by [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and [[Corona Australis]] to the north, [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]] to the west, [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] to the south, and [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] to the east, cornering on [[Microscopium]] to the northeast. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Tel'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|18|09.1}} and {{RA|20|29.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −45.09° and −56.98°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Telescopium}}

== Notable features ==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Telescopium}}

There are no European names for stars in this constellation.  The [[Culture of China|Chinese]] did assign names to [[Alpha Telescopii|α Tel]] (We, meaning danger), and [[G Scorpii|γ Tel]] (the present-day [[G Scorpii]]) as Chuen Shwo, with a mythological meaning.

With an [[apparent magnitude]] of  3.5, [[Alpha Telescopii]] is the brightest star in the constellation. It is a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B3IV which lies around 250 light years away.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alpha Telescopii''}} Close by Alpha are the two blue-white stars sharing the designation of [[Delta Telescopii]]. Delta¹ is of spectral type B6IV and apparent magnitude 4.9,{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6934}} while Delta² is of spectral type B3III and magnitude 5.1.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6938}} They form an [[optical double]], as the stars are 800 and 1120 light years away respectively.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=242–43}} The second brightest star in the constellation is [[Zeta Telescopii]] of apparent magnitude 4.1 and spectral type K1III-IV.{{sfn|SIMBAD LTT 7332}} 127 light years distant, it has been described as yellow,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=242–43}} or reddish in appearance.{{sfn|Streicher|2009|pp=168–71}} [[Epsilon Telescopii]] is another double star, though this time a true binary system.{{sfn|Ferreira|2009|pp=166–67}}  Epsilon Telescopii A is an orange [[giant star|giant]] of spectral type K0III with an [[apparent magnitude]] of +4.52,{{sfn|SIMBAD Epsilon Telescopii}} with a 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, 21 [[arcsecond]]s away from the primary, and just visible with a 15&amp;nbsp;cm telescope on a dark night. The system is 409 light years away.{{sfn|Ferreira|2009|pp=166–67}} [[Kappa Telescopii]] is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18.{{sfn|SIMBAD Kappa Telescopii}}  It is approximately 293 light years from Earth, and is another optical double.{{sfn|Ferreira|2009|pp=166–67}}  [[RR Telescopii]], also designated ''Nova Telescopium 1948'', often called a slow nova is now classified as a [[symbiotic nova]] system composed of an M5III pulsating [[red giant]] and a [[white dwarf]]; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948.&lt;ref name=rob1975&gt;{{cite journal | last=Robinson | first=E.

===Deep sky objects===
The [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6584]] lies near [[Theta Arae]] and is 45000 light years distant.{{sfn|Streicher|2009|pp=168–71}} It is an [[Globular cluster#Metallic content|Oosterhoff type I]] cluster, and contains at least 59 variable stars, most of which are [[RR Lyrae variable]]s.{{sfn|Toddy|2012|63–71}} The [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 4699]] is of 13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii.{{sfn|Streicher|2009|pp=168–71}}

There are a group of twelve galaxies spanning three degrees in the northeastern part of the constellation. They lie around 120 million light years from our own galaxy.{{sfn|Streicher|2009|pp=168–71}} This group is known as the Telescopium group or AS0851. The brightest is the elliptical galaxy [[NGC 6868]].{{sfn|Machacek|O'Sullivan|Randall|Jones|2010|p=1316–32}} To the west lies the spiral galaxy [[NGC 6861]].{{sfn|Streicher|2009|pp=168–71}} These are the brightest members of two respective subgroups within the galaxy group, and are heading toward a merger in the future.{{sfn|Machacek|O'Sullivan|Randall|Jones|2010|p=1316–32}}

On September 9, 2012, [[Voyager 2]] was {{Convert|99.077|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth and {{Convert|99.504|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Sun; and traveling at {{Convert|15.436|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} (relative to the Sun) and traveling outward at about 3.256 AU per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peat-20120909&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Peat |first=Chris |title=Spacecraft escaping the Solar System |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx |date=September 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Heavens-Above]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight takes 13.73 hours to get to ''Voyager 2''. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude -16.7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peat-20120909&quot; /&gt; ''Voyager 2'' is heading in the direction of the constellation Telescopium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peat-20120909&quot; /&gt;

'''Volans''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It represents a [[flying fish]]; its name is a shortened form of its original name, '''Piscis Volans'''.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}} Volans was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}}

==History==

Volans is one of the 12 constellations that were introduced by the Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] in the late 16th century. It was first depicted on [[Petrus Plancius]]’ globe in 1598. Plancius called the constellation ''Vliegendenvis'' (flying fish).&lt;ref&gt;Constellations: A Guide to the Night Sky (2013) available at  &lt;http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/volans-constellation/.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Johann Bayer]] included the constellation in his star atlas ''Uranometria'' under the name ''Piscis Volans'', the flying fish. It was known by that name until the mid-19th century, when [[John Herschel]] suggested that the name be shortened to just &quot;Volans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volans represents a type of tropical fish that can jump out of the water and glide through the air on wings.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In early celestial maps, the flying fish was often depicted as accompanying the ship [[Argo Navis]], and being chased by the predatory fish represented by the [[Dorado]] constellation.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stars==
There are two [[double star]]s within the constellation which can be observed using a small [[telescope]], [[Gamma Volantis]] and [[Epsilon Volantis]], along with two [[galaxies]] which may be more difficult to see clearly, [[NGC 2442]] and [[NGC 2434]]. The magnitudes of the Gamma Volantis stars are fourth and sixth, and of Epsilon Volantis fourth and eighth.&lt;ref name=&quot;?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=SEDS |url=http://seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/volans.html |date= 28 August 1997 |publisher=SEDS |accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2007}}

==Deep-sky objects==
Volans has several deep-sky objects within its borders.

The [[Lindsay-Shapley ring]], also categorized as AM0644-741, is a [[ring galaxy]] located 300 million light-years from Earth. Named for its discoverers, the Lindsay-Shapley ring was found near the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] in 1960. Like the [[Cartwheel Galaxy]] in [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]], the unusual shape of this galaxy results from a [[galactic merger|collision]] many millions of years ago. The blue ring, 150,000 light-years in diameter, was formed when a [[shock wave]] from the collision [[star formation|created]] a ring of hot blue stars; the yellow core is an amalgamation of the progenitors' cores.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} [[NGC 2442]], an intermediate-spiral galaxy, is also located in this constellation, with a distance of 50 million light-years from Earth.

'''Pictor''' is a small and faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky (declination &amp;minus;50° to &amp;minus;60°), located between the brilliant star [[Canopus]] and the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[Painting|painter]], but it is in fact an abbreviation of its original name '''Equuleus Pictoris''', the 'painter's [[easel]]', and it is normally represented as an easel. It was invented and named by Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in the 18th century.

Pictor has attracted attention in recent years because of its second-brightest star [[Beta Pictoris]], 63.4 [[light-year]]s distant, which is surrounded by an unusual [[dust disk]] rich in [[carbon]], as well as an [[extrasolar planet]]. Another four stars in the constellation have been found to have extrasolar planets. The constellation also hosts [[RR Pictoris]], a [[nova]] which brightened to magnitude 1.2 in 1925.

==History==
The French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  first described the constellation as '' le Chevalet et la Palette'' (the easel and palette) in 1756,{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Pictor}} and gave [[Bayer designation]]s to ten stars now named Alpha to Nu Pictoris (he erred in naming the wrong star with the Greek letter epsilon, which is now not used).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=246}} He labelled it Equuleus Pictorius on his 1763 chart.&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences--&gt;, the word &quot;Equuleus&quot; meaning ass, small horse, or easel, perhaps from an old custom among artists of carrying a canvass on a donkey.{{sfn|Chartrand|1982|p=176}}  [[Johann Bode]] called it Pluteum Pictoris. The name  was shortened to Pictor in 1845 by [[Francis Baily]] on the suggestion of Sir [[John Herschel]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Pictor}}

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Constellation Pictor.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Pictor as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

Pictor is a small constellation bordered by [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the north, [[Puppis]] and [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] to the east, [[Caelum]] to the northwest, [[Dorado]] to the southwest and [[Volans]] to the south. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Pic'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 18 segments.  In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|04|32.5}} and {{RA|06|52.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −42.79° and −64.15°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Pictor}} Pictor [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at 9 p.m. on 17 March.{{sfn|The Constellations : Part 2 Culmination Times}} Its position in the far southern celestial hemisphere means that it is invisible from Europe.

{{see also|List of stars in Pictor}}
Pictor is a faint constellation, its three brightest stars forming a line near the bright star [[Canopus]].{{sfn|Moore, .27.27Stargazing.27.27|2000|p=118}} Located around 97 light-years away from Earth, [[Alpha Pictoris]] is the brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of 3.3 and spectral type A8VnkA6.{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Pictoris}} [[Beta Pictoris]] is another white [[Main sequence|main sequence star]] of spectral type A6V and apparent magnitude 3.86.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Pictoris}} In 1984, Beta was the first star discovered to have a [[debris disk]].{{sfn|Smith|1984}}  Since then a planet around 8 times the mass of Jupiter has been discovered orbiting around 8 AU away from the star—a similar distance between our Sun and Saturn. The [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) has since confirmed its presence through the use of [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Direct imaging|direct imagery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Exoplanet Caught on the Move|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1024/|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=25 May 2014|author=Lagrange, Anne-Marie|publisher = [[European Southern Observatory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamma Pictoris]] is an orange giant of spectral type K1III and apparent magnitude 4.5 lying around 174 light years distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD Gamma Pictoris}} [[HD 42540]], called 47 Pictoris by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould]], is another orange giant, this time of spectral type K2.5III and average magnitude 5.04.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 2196}} It is a suspected variable star.{{sfn|AAVSO HR 2196}} Lacaille mistakenly named this star Mu Doradus, but had recorded its Right Ascension one hour too small.{{sfn|Harvard College Observatory|1883}} Lacaille named two neighbouring stars Eta Pictoris.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=246}} [[Eta2 Pictoris|Eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Pictoris]], also known as HR 1663, is an orange giant of spectral type K5III and apparent magnitude 5.05. It is 474 light years distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 1663}} [[Eta1 Pictoris|Eta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Pictoris]], also known as HR 1649, is 85 light years distant and is a main sequence star of spectral type F5V and visual magnitude 5.38.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 1649}} A double star, it has a companion of magnitude 13 separated by 11 arcseconds.{{sfn|SIMBAD CD-49 1541B}}

Located around 1298 light-years from Earth, [[Delta Pictoris]] is an eclipsing binary of the [[Beta Lyrae variable|Beta Lyrae]] type.{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Pictoris}} Composed of two blue stars of spectral types B3III and O9V, the system has a period of 1.67 days, and is observed to dip from apparent magnitude 4.65 to 4.9.{{sfn|Malkov|Oblak|2006}} The stars are oval shaped.{{sfn|Cousins|1966}} [[TV Pictoris]] is a spectroscopic binary system composed of an A-type star and an F-type star which rotate around each other in a very close orbit. The latter star is elliptical in shape and shows some intrinsic variability.{{sfn|Pavlovski|1998}} The visual magnitude ranges between 7.37 and 7.53 every 20 hours.{{sfn|AAVSO TV Pictoris}}

Aside from Beta, four other stars in Pictor are known to host planetary systems. [[AB Pictoris]] is a [[BY Draconis variable]] star with a companion that is an [[extrasolar planet]] or a [[brown dwarf]]. [[HD 40307]] is an orange main sequence star of spectral type K2.5V and apparent magnitude 7.17 located around 42 light-years away. As of 7 November 2012, research indicates that HD 40307 is host to six [[super-earth]] planets, one of which, [[HD 40307 g]], lies in the habitable zone of the star, and is far enough away to not be tidally locked (unlike the other planets in the same system, and many other exoplanets which orbit close to their parent stars.) &lt;ref&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1617&lt;/ref&gt; [[HD 41004]] is a complex binary system about 139 light years distant. The primary is an orange dwarf of spectral type K1V orbited by a planet roughly 2.65 times the mass of Jupiter every 963 days, while the secondary is a red dwarf of spectral type M2V and orbited by a [[brown dwarf]] that is at least 19 times as massive as Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2004A&amp;A...426..695Z |author=Zucker, S.; Mazeh, T.; Santos, N.C.; Udry, S.; Mayor, M. |title=Multi-order TODCOR: Application to Observations Taken with the CORALIE Echelle Spectrograph.

[[Kapteyn's Star]], a nearby [[red dwarf]] at the distance of 12.78 light years, has a magnitude of 8.8. It has the largest [[proper motion]] of any star in the sky after [[Barnard's Star]].{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|pp=374–75}} Moving around the Milky Way in the opposite direction to most other stars, it may have originated in a dwarf galaxy that was merged into our galaxy, with the main remnant being the [[Omega Centauri]] globular cluster.{{sfn|Kotoneva|2005}}

Located 1.5 degrees west southwest of Alpha, [[RR Pictoris]] is a [[cataclysmic variable]] that flared up as a [[nova]], reaching magnitude 1.2 in on 9 June 1925.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|pp=374–75}} It is a close binary system  composed of a [[white dwarf]] and secondary star that orbit each other every 3.48 hours—so close that the secondary is filling up its [[Roche lobe]] with stellar material, which is then transferred onto the first star's [[accretion disc]]. Once this material reaches a critical mass, it ignites and the system brightens tremendously. Calculations of the speed suggest the secondary star is not dense enough for its size to still be on the main sequence, so it itself must have begun expanding and cooling already as its core has run out of hydrogen fuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ribeiro06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ribeiro, Fabíola M. A.; Diaz, Marcos P.|date=2006|title=A Tomographic Study of the Classical Nova RR Pictoris|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=118|issue=839|pages=84-93|jstor=498458}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TW Pictoris]] is a cataclysmic variable system of magnitude 14 which contains a magnetic white dwarf, and is an X-ray source.{{sfn|Patterson|Moulden|1993}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Pictor A Chandra X-ray.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A Chandra X-ray image of Pictor A showing a jet emanating from it.]]
[[NGC 1705]] is an irregular dwarf galaxy 17 million light-years from Earth. It is one of the most active [[star formation|star forming]] galaxies in the nearby universe, despite the fact that its rate of star formation peaked around 30 million years ago.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

[[Pictor A]] is a remote double lobed [[radio galaxy]] which is a powerful source of radio waves in the southern sky.{{sfn|Perley|1997}} From a [[supermassive black hole]] at its centre, a [[relativistic jet]] shoots out to an X ray hot spot 800,000 light years away.{{sfn|ChandraPR}}

[[SPT-CL J0546-5345]] is a massive [[galaxy cluster]] located around 7 billion light years away with a mass equivalent to approximately 800 trillion suns.{{sfn|Ghosts of the Future}}

'''Crux''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ʌ|k|s}} is the [[List of constellations by area|smallest]] of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, but is one of the most distinctive. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[cross]], and it is dominated by a cross-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that is commonly known as the '''Southern Cross'''.

==Visibility==
[[Image:Crux (Southern Cross) from Hobart, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The five brightest stars in Crux are clearly visible in the top right. The [[red giant]] [[Gacrux]] and orange giant [[Epsilon Crucis|Epsilon]] are distinctly different from the three other major stars of the constellation, which are blue-white in colour.]]
[[Image:Ctx crux.gif|thumb|250px|left|A [[CTX (camera)|CTX]] image of Crux.]]

[[File:Crux-20100220.jpg|thumb|right|Stacked image of six identical frames of Crux.]]
Crux is easily visible from the [[southern hemisphere]] at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from [[Tropics|tropical latitudes]] of the [[northern hemisphere]] for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from [[Cancun]] or any other place at latitude 25° N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Field Guide to the Stars and Planets | author=Pasachoff, Jay M | year=2000 | publisher=Houghton Miflin | isbn=978-0-395-93431-9 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Ian Ridpath.com: Constellations | accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 5 main stars.

==Location and identification==
In tropical regions Crux can be seen in the sky from April to June. Crux is exactly opposite to [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in the sky with the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34°S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky.

Crux is bordered by the constellations [[Centaurus]] (which surrounds it on three sides) and [[Musca]].

Crux is sometimes confused with the nearby [[Vela (constellation)#False Cross|False Cross]] by stargazers. Crux is somewhat [[kite (geometry)|kite]]-shaped, and it has a fifth star ([[Epsilon Crucis|ε Crucis]]). The False Cross is [[diamond]]-shaped, somewhat dimmer on average, does not have a fifth star and lacks the two prominent nearby &quot;Pointer Stars.&quot;

===Stars===

Three of the five main Crux stars—[[Alpha Crucis|Acrux]], [[Beta Crucis|Mimosa]], and [[Delta Crucis]]—are co-moving B-type members of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]], the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]] to the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Nearest OB Association: Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco OB2)|author=Preibisch, T., Mamajek, E.|year=2008|journal=Handbook of Star-Forming Regions|volume=2|pages=0|bibcode=2008hsf2.book..235P|arxiv=0809.0407}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989A&amp;A...216...44D | author=de Geus, E.

The star [[HD 106906]] has been found to have a planet—[[HD 106906 b]]—that has a larger orbit than any other exoplanet discovered to date.

====Markers====
Alpha and Gamma (known as [[Acrux]] and [[Gacrux]] respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Tracing a line from Gacrux to Acrux leads to a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri]], the point where the above mentioned line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial Pole. The two stars of Alpha and Beta Centauri are often referred to as the &quot;Southern Pointers&quot; or just &quot;The Pointers&quot;, allowing people to easily find the asterism of the Southern Cross or the constellation of Crux.

====Letters and names====
The four main stars that form the asterism are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Crucis. [[Alpha Crucis]], called Acrux, is a triple star 321 light-years from Earth. Blue-tinged and magnitude 0.8 to the unaided eye, it has two close components of magnitude 1.3 and 1.8, as well as a wide component of magnitude 5. The two close components are divisible in a small amateur telescope and the wide component is divisible in a pair of binoculars. [[Beta Crucis]], called Mimosa, is a blue-hued giant of magnitude 1.3, 353 light-years from Earth. It is a [[Beta Cephei]]-type [[Cepheid variable]] with a variation of less than 0.1 magnitudes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} [[Gamma Crucis]], called Gacrux, is a [[double star]]. The primary is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 1.6, 88 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 6.5, 264 light-years from Earth. [[Delta Crucis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 364 light-years from Earth. It is the dimmest of the Southern Cross stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

There are several dimmer stars within the borders of Crux. [[Epsilon Crucis]] is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6, 228 light-years from Earth. [[Iota Crucis]] is a [[binary star]] 125 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is of magnitude 9.5. [[Mu Crucis]] is a double star where the unrelated components are about 370 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.0 and the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.1. Mu Crucis is divisible in small amateur telescopes or large binoculars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Southern Cross and Coalsack Dark Nebula.jpg|thumb|Southern Cross and Coalsack Nebula]]
The [[Coalsack Nebula]] is the most prominent [[dark nebula]] in the skies, easily visible to the naked eye as a prominent dark patch in the southern Milky Way. It is large, five degrees by seven degrees, and is 600 light-years from Earth. Not all of the nebula is in the borders of Crux; some of it is technically in [[Musca]] and [[Centaurus]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

The [[open cluster]] NGC 4755, better known as the [[Jewel Box (star cluster)|Jewel Box]] or Kappa Crucis Cluster, has an overall magnitude of 4.2—to the naked eye it appears to be a fuzzy star—{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}and is about 7600 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} The cluster was given its name by [[John Herschel]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} About seven million years old, an age that makes it one of the youngest open clusters in the Milky Way, it appears to have the shape of a letter A. The Jewel Box Clusters is a Shapley class g and Trumpler class I 3 r cluster; it is a very rich, centrally-concentrated cluster detached from the surrounding star field. It has more than 100 stars that range significantly in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} The brightest stars are mostly [[blue supergiant]]s, though the cluster contains a few bright [[red supergiant]]s. [[Kappa Crucis]] is a true member of the cluster that bears its name, and is one of the brighter star at magnitude 5.9.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

==History==
[[Image:Southern Celestial Map of Mestre João Faras.gif|thumb|Depiction of the Crux (labelled 'Las Guardas') by physician-astronomer Mestre [[João Faras]] in his letter of May 1, 1500, to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] from the newly discovered land of [[Brazil]]]]

Crux was visible to the [[Ancient Greeks]]; [[Ptolemy]] regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus.&lt;ref&gt;Pasachoff, [http://books.google.pl/books?hl=pl&amp;id=aKPWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=crux#search_anchor ''Stars and Planets''], 2006, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=247}} It was entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the [[precession of the equinoxes]] gradually lowered its stars below the [[Europe]]an horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} By AD 400, most of the constellation never rose above the horizon for Athenians.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The 15th-century Venetian navigator [[Alvise Cadamosto]] made note of what was probably the Southern Cross on exiting the [[Gambia River]] in 1455, calling it the ''carro dell'ostro'' (&quot;southern chariot&quot;).  However, Cadamosto's constellation had too many stars and was tilted incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We likewise observed...due south by compass, a constellation of six large bright stars, in the figure of a cross in this form...we conjectured this to be the southern chariot, but could not expect to observe the principal star, as we had not yet lost sight of the north pole.&quot; A.

Faras sketched and described the constellation (calling it &quot;Las Guardas&quot;) in a letter written on the beaches of Brazil on May 1, 1500, to the Portuguese monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Revista do Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro |location = Rio de Janeiro |year = 1843 |volume = V nº 19. |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=fx1-Np41_90C&amp;pg=PA342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern description clearly describing Crux as a separate constellation is attributed to [[Andrea Corsali|Andreas Corsali]], an Italian navigator who from 1515 to 1517 sailed to China and the East Indies in an expedition sponsored by King Manuel I. In 1516, Corsali wrote a letter to the monarch describing his observations of the southern sky, which included a small map showing 19 stars and the two Magellanic Clouds in a geocentric orientation, along with a vivid textual description of the Southern Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = Nick Kanas | title = Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography, Second Edition |location = Chichester, U.K. |year = 2012 |page = 118| ISBN =978-1-4614-0917-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émerie Mollineux]] has also been cited as the first uranographer to distinguish Crux; his illustration dates to 1592. Later adopters of the constellation included [[Jakob Bartsch]] in 1624 and [[Augustin Royer]] in 1679. Royer is sometimes wrongly cited as initially distinguishing Crux.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=247}} Explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] depicted Crux as an [[almond]], called &quot;Mandorla&quot;.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

Crux was first shown as a separate constellation on the celestial globes of [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]] in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by [[Frederick de Houtman]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/crux.htm | title=Ian Ridpath’s Star Tales – Crux | accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance of the Southern Cross==
The most prominent feature of Crux is the distinctive asterism known as the Southern Cross. It has great significance in the cultures of the southern hemisphere, particularly of Australia, whose citizens colloquially refer to themselves as sons and daughters of the Southern Cross.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/national/sons-and-daughters-of-the-southern-cross-20091009-gqub.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flags and symbols===
{{main|Flags depicting the Southern Cross}}
[[Image:Southern cross appearing on a number of flags.PNG|thumb|250px|Crux, appearing on a number of flags and insignia]]
Beginning in the colonial age, Crux became used as a national symbol by several southern nations. The brightest stars of Crux appear on the flags of [[flag of Australia|Australia]], [[flag of Brazil|Brazil]], [[flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]]. They also appear on the flags of the [[flag of Victoria|Australian state of Victoria]], the [[flag of Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]], the [[flag of Northern Territory|Northern Territory]], as well as the flag of [[Magallanes Region of Chile]], the flag of [[Londrina]] (Brazil) and several [[Argentina|Argentine]] provincial flags and emblems (for example, ''[[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]]'' and ''[[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]]''). The flag of the [[Mercosur]] trading zone displays the four brightest stars. Crux also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Brazil|Brazilian coat of arms]].

In Australia, the Southern Cross played a crucial role as symbol of the [[Eureka Stockade]]. In the Eureka Oath from [[Peter Lalor]]'s famous speech in 1854 under the [[Eureka Flag]] he proclaimed &quot;We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.&quot; Of the Australian national flag, the Australian poet [[Banjo Paterson]] wrote in 1893: &lt;blockquote&gt;The English flag may flutter and wave,&lt;br&gt; where the world wide oceans toss,&lt;br&gt;but the flag the Australian dies to save,&lt;br&gt;is the flag of the Southern Cross.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Southern Cross was written into the lyrics of &quot;[[Advance Australia Fair]]&quot; in 1901: &quot;Beneath our radiant Southern Cross&quot;; the song was adopted as the Australian National Anthem in 1984. The victory song of the Australian national cricket team is entitled &quot;[[Under the Southern Cross I Stand]]&quot;.

The Southern Cross was included in the lyrics of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]] (1909): &quot;''A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece''&quot; (&quot;the image of the Cross shines&quot;). The five stars are also in the logo of the Brazilian football team [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] and the [[Brazilian coat of arms]]; it is mentioned in the Brazilian national anthem, and even featured as the name of the currency (the ''[[Brazilian cruzeiro|cruzeiro]]'' from 1942 to 1986 and again from 1990 to 1994. The constellation is displayed in all coins of the current series of the [[Brazilian real]].

In [[O Sweet Saint Martin's Land]], the lyrics for the Southern Cross are ''Thy Southern Cross the night''.

A stylized version of Crux appears on the Australian [[Eureka Flag]]. The constellation was also used on the dark blue, shield-like patch worn by personnel of the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]], which was organized in the Southern Hemisphere, on the island of [[New Caledonia]], and also the blue diamond of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], which fought on the Southern Hemisphere islands of [[Guadalcanal]] and [[New Britain]].

===In non-Western astronomy===
In [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]], Crux and the [[Coalsack]] mark the head of the 'Emu in the Sky' in several [[Aboriginal cultures]], while Crux itself is said to be a [[possum]] sitting in a tree and a representation of the sky deity Mirrabooka. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In ancient [[Jyotisha|Hindu astrology]], the modern Crux is referred to as ''[[Trishanku]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;crux&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Crux - Trishanku| publisher = Space Yuga | date =2010-02-10 | url = http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/ | accessdate = 2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various peoples in the [[East Indies]] and Brazil viewed the four main stars as the body of a [[ray (fish)|ray.]]{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}} In both Indonesia and Malaysia, it is known as ''Bintang Pari'' and ''Buruj Pari'' respectively (&quot;ray stars&quot;)

The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people of Indonesia called this constellation ''Gubug pèncèng'' (&quot;raking hut&quot;) or ''lumbung'' (&quot;the granary&quot;), because the shape of the constellation was like a [[raking hut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Daldjoeni |first = N. |year = 1984  |title = Pranatamangsa, the javanese agricultural calendar – Its bioclimatological and sociocultural function in developing rural life. |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/vru6945817245389/ |journal = The Environmentalist |volume = 4 |pages=15–18 |doi=10.1007/BF01907286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name for the Southern Cross is ''Te Punga'' (&quot;the [[anchor]]&quot;). It is thought of as the anchor of Tama-rereti's ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]'' (the [[Milky Way]]), while the Pointers are its rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?wordID=10907 |title=Māori Dictionary; Waka o Tama-rereti, Te |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mapudungun]], the language of Patagonian [[Mapuche]]s, the name of the Southern Cross is ''Melipal'', which means &quot;four stars&quot;. In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the language of the [[Inca]] civilization, Crux is known as &quot;[[Chakana]]&quot;, which means literally &quot;stair&quot; (''chaka'', bridge, link; ''hanan'', high, above), but carries a deep symbolism within Quechua mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/941062 |title = Chakana: Inca Cross |date = 23 June 2007 |accessdate = 9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Samoa the constellation is called ''Sumu'' (&quot;triggerfish&quot;) because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called ''Luatagata'' (Two Men), just as they are in Tonga.

In [[Tonga]] it is known as ''Toloa'' (&quot;duck&quot;); it is depicted as a duck flying south, with one of his wings ([[Delta Crucis|δ Crucis]]) wounded because ''Ongo tangata'' (&quot;two men&quot;, [[α Centauri|α]] and [[β Centauri]]) threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as ''Humu'' (the &quot;[[triggerfish]]&quot;), because of its shape.{{sfn|Velt|1990}}

Among [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s, the four most visible stars of Crux are considered ''iggaren'', i.e. four ''[[Maerua crassifolia]]'' trees.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The [[Tswana people]] of [[Botswana]] saw the constellation as ''Dithutlwa'', two giraffes - Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Andrew|year=1986|title=Some Aspects of Tswana Cosmology|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=18|pages=33–37|jstor=40979758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acrux and Mimosa make up one foot of the Great Rhea, a constellation encompassing [[Centaurus]] and [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] along with the two bright stars. The Great Rhea was a constellation of the [[Bororo people]] of Brazil. The [[Mocoví people]] of Argentina also saw a [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] including the stars of Crux. Their rhea is attacked by two dogs, represented by bright stars in Centaurus and Circinus. The dogs' heads are marked by [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]]. The rhea's body is marked by the four main stars of Crux, while its head is [[Gamma Centauri]] and its feet are the bright stars of [[Musca]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=251}}

The [[Bakairi people]] of Brazil had a sprawling constellation representing a bird snare. It included the bright stars of Crux, the southern part of Centaurus, Circinus, at least one star in [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]], the bright stars of Musca, [[Beta Chamaeleonis|Beta]] and [[Delta Chamaeleonis]], [[Volans]], and Mensa.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=250}}

The [[Kalapalo people]] of [[Mato Grosso]] state in Brazilsaw the stars of Crux as ''Aganagi'' angry bees having emerged from the Coalsack, which they saw as the beehive.&lt;ref name=&quot;basso87&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Basso|first=Ellen B. |title=In Favor of Deceit: A Study of Tricksters in an Amazonian Society|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=1987|pages=360|isbn=0816510229|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BPpiOzIVGJAC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=Coalsack+Crux+Musca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9dLBUvHQH6PeigeNuIGIDQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Coalsack%20Crux%20Musca&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of the [[Solomon Islands]] saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a knee protector and a net used to catch [[Palolo worm]]s. Neighboring peoples in the [[Marshall Islands]] saw these stars as a fish.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

Two Pacific constellations also included [[Gamma Centauri]]. [[Torres Strait Islanders]] in modern-day Australia saw Gamma Centauri as the handle and the four stars as the [[trident]] of [[Tagai]]'s Fishing Spear. The [[Aranda people]] of central Australia saw the four Cross stars as the talon of an [[eagle]] and Gamma Centauri as its leg.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

===In popular culture===

[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Gaucho]]s are well known for using it for night orientation in the vast [[Pampa]]s and [[Patagonia|Patagonic]] regions. It is also of cultural significance, as it is referenced in several songs and literature, including the [[Martin Fierro]]. The Argentinian singer [[Charly Garcia]] says that he is from the southern cross in the song &quot;No voy en tren&quot;.

The [[Argentine Air Force]] acrobatic display team is called ''[[Southern Cross Aerobatic Squadron|Cruz del Sur]]'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

In the ''Victory At Sea'' suite, [[Richard Rodgers]] wrote &quot;Beneath The Southern Cross&quot; to depict the battleships in convoy and the loneliness of the sailors in the Southern Pacific during World War II. This tango melody is also &quot;No Other Love Have I&quot; in the musical &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; and a popular hit for [[Perry Como]] during the 1950s.

[[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] (Crux/Southern Cross Sports Club) is a first class football (soccer) club in Brazil.

[[Melbourne]]'s [[Southern Cross Hotel]] was built and named in 1962 and was one of the city's foremost hotels during the decade. The hotel was demolished in 2005 and replaced by the similarly named office building known as [[Southern Cross Tower]]. There is a town in the Western Australian wheatbelt approx 300&amp;nbsp;km east of Perth called [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]]. Melbourne's [[Southern Cross railway station, Melbourne|Spencer Street Station]] was rebuilt and renamed &quot;Southern Cross Station&quot; in 2006.

The 1974 Australian [[America's Cup]] Challenger was named &quot;Southern Cross&quot; KA 4 representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club and was defeated 4-0 sailing off Newport Rhode Island by &quot;Courageous&quot; US26 sailing for the New York Yacht Club. Southern Cross became the trial horse for the 1977 Australian Challenger &quot;Australia&quot; KA 5 representing the Sun City Yacht Club that was defeated 4-0 sailing off Newport Rhode Island by Courageous US26 sailing for the New York Yacht Club.

The [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] uses a stylized image of the Southern Cross as a corporate logo.

[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|&quot;Southern Cross&quot;]] is also a 1982 song by the classic rock group [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]], written by Rick Curtis, Michael Curtis, and [[Stephen Stills]]. This song was also covered by [[Jimmy Buffett]] and is commonly played at his concerts.

After identifying a need for a church for Afrikaans speakers living in the Netherlands, a church was established in [[Leusden]] and is known as Suiderkruis Kerk. (Southern Cross Church) There is a town called Suiderkruis (Southern Cross) in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. The opening lines of South African composer [[Koos du Plessis]]' Christmas carol, 'Somerkersfees' (Summer Christmas) are:
:''Welkom o stille nag van vrede''   (Welcome, o silent night of peace)
:''Onder die suiderkruis''            (Beneath the Southern Cross)

''[[Zeitgeist: the Movie]]'' claims that the Sun can be in the ''vicinity'' of Crux: this is seen through the northern hemisphere of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Constellation |at=(Table of all constellations) |title=Constellation |publisher=Swinburne University |work=Cosmos - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/Z/Zodiac |title=Zodiac |publisher=Swinburne University |work=Cosmos - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 video game [[Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception]], Crux plays a major role in the story of the game and is the name of the player's radio operator.

The 1981 Black Sabbath album ''[[Mob Rules]]'' features the song &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross&quot;, whose lyrics were written by then member and vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]].

==Use in navigation==
[[Image:Pole01-eng.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Locating the south celestial pole]]
In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Southern Cross is frequently used for navigation in much the same way that the [[Pole Star]] is used in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

The south celestial pole can be located from the [[Southern Cross]] (Crux) and its two &quot;pointer&quot; stars [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri|β Centauri]]. Draw an imaginary line from [[Gamma Crucis|γ Crucis]] to [[Alpha Crucis|α Crucis]]&amp;mdash;the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross&amp;mdash;and follow this line through the sky. Either go four and a half times the distance of the long axis in the direction the narrow end of the cross points, or join the two pointer stars with a line, divide this line in half, then at right angles draw another imaginary line through the sky until it meets the line from the Southern Cross. This point is 5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation [[Musca]] is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.&lt;ref name= Grainger/&gt;

A technique used in the field is to clench one's right fist and to view the cross, aligning the first knuckle with the axis of the cross.  The tip of the thumb will indicate south.&lt;ref name= Grainger&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8431">The '''Decans''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|k|ən|z|}} (Egyptian ''bakiu'') are 36 groups of stars (small constellations) which rise consecutively on the horizon throughout each earth rotation.  The rising of each ''decan'' marked the beginning of a new decanal &quot;hour&quot; (Greek ''hōra'') of the night for the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, and they were used as a sidereal [[star clock]] beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (ca 2100 BCE.)

Because a new decan also appears [[heliacal rising|heliacally]] every ten days (that is, every ten days, a new decanic star group reappears in the eastern sky at dawn right before the Sun rises, after a period of being obscured by the Sun's light), the ancient Greeks called them ''dekanoi'' (pl. of ''dekanos'') or &quot;tenths&quot;  (and when the concept of decans reached northern India, they were called ''[[drekkana]]'' in [[Sanskrit]].)  These predictable heliacal re-appearances by the decans were eventually used by the Egyptians to mark the divisions of their annual solar [[calendar]].  Thus the heliacal rising of [[Sirius]] marked the annual flooding of the Nile.

Eventually this system led to a system of 12 daytime hours and 12 nighttime hours, varying in length according to the season.  Later, a system of 24 &quot;equinoctial&quot; hours was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-22332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Hellenistic astrology|astrology]] was introduced to Egypt, various systems attributing astrological significance to decans arose.  Decans were connected, for example, with various diseases and with the timing for the engraving of talismans for curing them;&lt;ref&gt;see for example, RUELLE, C. E., ''Hermès Trismégiste, Le livre sacré sur les décans. Texte, variantes et traduction française,'' Revue de philologie, de littérature et d'histoire
anciennes, n.s.:32:4 (1908:oct.) p .247&lt;/ref&gt; with decanic &quot;faces&quot; (or &quot;phases&quot;), a system where three decans are assigned to each zodiacal sign, each covering 10° of the zodiac, and each ruled by a planetary ruler (see below); and correlated with astrological signs.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Firmicus Maternus, ''Matheseos'' IV/22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decans continued to be used throughout the [[Renaissance]] in astrology and in magic, but modern astrologers almost entirely ignore them.

== Ancient Egyptian origins ==

Decans first appeared in the 10th Dynasty (2100 BCE) on coffin lids.  The sequence of these star patterns began with Sothis/Sirius, and each decan contained a set of stars and corresponding divinities.  As measures of time, the rising and setting of decans marked 'hours' and groups of 10 days which comprised an Egyptian year.

There were 36&lt;ref&gt;von Bomhard, Dr. A. S., The Egyptian Calendar a Work for Eternity, London 1999, page 51&lt;/ref&gt; decans (36 X 10 = 360 days). plus 5 added days to compose the 365 days of a solar based year. Decans measure sidereal time and the solar year is 6 hours longer; the Sothic and solar years in the Egyptian calendar realign every 1460 years. Decans represented on coffins from later dynasties (such as King Seti I) compared with earlier decan images demonstrate the Sothic-solar shift.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt; as used as an [[essential dignity]] in astrology.&lt;/small&gt;

Notice that rulerships follow a repeating pattern, the so-called &quot;Chaldaean&quot; order of the planets:    ''Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.''
This planetary order, in which the Sun stands at the center of the continuum, with the planets between the Sun and the Earth on one side and the outer planets on the other side, reflected the perception of the speed of each planet's motion as seen from the Earth.

Decans or &quot;faces&quot; are the least important of the [[Essential dignity|essential dignities]], representing about one-fifteenth of a planet's overall strength in medieval astrology.

== Ancient India ==
In India, the division of the zodiac into 36 ten degree portions is called either the drekkana (drekkāṇa),the dreshkana (dreṣkāṇa), or the drikana (dṛkāṇa).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The iconography and use of the drekkana’s is mention earliest by [[Sphujidhvaja]] in [[Yavanajataka]] (269-70 CE), and given detailed treatment by [[Varahamihira]] in his [[Brihat-Samhita]] (550 CE). Modern scholars believe the decans were imported into India through the Greeks, who learned about them from the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Pingree, David. The Indian Iconography of the Decans and Horas. Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol 26, No.3/4, 1963, pp.223–254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple types of drekkana in use in Indian astrology. The parivritti drekkana goes in order of the signs; the first decan is Aries, the second is Taurus, the third is Gemini, the fourth is Cancer, etc. Then there is the trinal calculation which utilizes the elemental trines to each sign; In Aries there is Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, while in Taurus there is Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. There are in total four variations of drekkana calculations. Indian astrologers will calculate these signs ([[Varga (astrology)|varga]]) and create a new chart based upon the sign placement for predictive purposes.

'''Caelum''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|əm}} is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its name means &quot;the [[chisel]]&quot; in [[Latin]], and it was formerly known as '''Caelum Scalptorium''' (&quot;the engraver's chisel&quot;). It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and [[solid angle|subtends a solid angle]] of around 0.038 [[steradian]]s, just less than that of [[Corona Australis]].

Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. The constellation's brightest star, [[Alpha Caeli]], is only of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.45, and only one other star ([[Gamma1 Caeli|Gamma&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Caeli]]) is brighter than magnitude 5. Other notable objects in Caelum are [[RR Caeli]], a [[binary star]] with one planet approximately {{convert|20.13|pc|ly}} away; [[X Caeli]], a [[Delta Scuti variable]] that forms an optical double with Gamma&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Caeli; and [[HE0450-2958]], a [[Seyfert galaxy]] that at first appeared as just a jet with no host galaxy visible.

== History ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Canis Major, Lepus, Columba Noachi &amp; Cela Sculptoris.jpg|thumb|left|Seen  as &quot;Cela Sculptoris&quot; in the lower right of this 1825 star chart from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''|alt=Caelum depicted in ''Urania's Mirror'']]
Caelum was first introduced in the eighteenth century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a French astronomer who introduced thirteen other southern constellations at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;LacailleStarTales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Lacaille |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Lacaille gave the constellation was originally romanized to ''Caelum Scalptorium'' (&quot;The Engraver's Chisel&quot;), and [[Francis Baily]] shortened this name to ''Caelum'' after a suggestion by [[John Herschel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CaelumStarTales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Caelum |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacaille's original chart, the constellation was shown as a [[burin]] and an [[échoppe]], although it has come to be recognized simply as a chisel.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaelumStarTales&quot;/&gt; [[Johann Elert Bode]] stated the name as plural, ''Caela Scalptoris'', but this did not stick.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagman&quot;/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Caelum is bordered by [[Dorado]] and [[Pictor]] to the south, [[Horologium]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] to the east, [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] to the north, and [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the west. Covering 125 [[square degree]]s, it ranks 81st of the [[88 modern constellations]] in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Southern Hemisphere's summer, and the whole constellation is visible for at least part of the year to observers south of latitude 41°N.&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|1=While parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between 41°N and 62°N, stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;}} Its main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consists of four stars, and twenty stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt; The constellation's boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a 12-sided polygon. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|04|19.5}} and {{RA|05|05.1}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between {{dec|−27.02}} and {{dec|−48.74}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caelum, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cae|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation &quot;Cae&quot; for the constellation in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=H.

Caelum is a faint constellation, having no star brighter than fourth [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] and only two brighter than fifth magnitude. Lacaille gave six stars [[Bayer designations]], labeling them Alpha to Zeta in 1756, but omitted Epsilon and designated two nearby stars as Gamma. Bode extended the designations to Rho for other stars but most have fallen out of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagman&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company | location = [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg, VA]]  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear [[Flamsteed designation]]s.{{efn|1=Flamsteed only catalogued stars that were visible from England, and so thus southern constellations such as Caelum have no Flamsteed designations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starnames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaler |first1=J.

The brightest star, [[Alpha Caeli]], is a double star, containing an [[F-type main-sequence star]] of magnitude 4.45 and a [[red dwarf]] of magnitude 12.5, {{convert|20.17|pc|ly}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlphaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=alf+Cae |title = * Alpha Caeli – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpha2Simbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=CCDM%20J04406-4152%20B |title = GJ 174.1 B – Flare star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beta Caeli]], another F-type star of magnitude 5.05, is further away, being located {{convert|28.67|pc|ly}} from Earth.

[[Gamma1 Caeli|Gamma&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Caeli]] is a [[double star]] with a [[red giant]] primary of magnitude 4.58 and a secondary of magnitude 8.1. The primary is {{convert|55.59|pc|ly}} from Earth. The two components are difficult to resolve with small amateur telescopes because of their difference in [[visual magnitude]] and their close separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;GammaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=gam+Cae |title = * Gamma Caeli – Star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This star system forms an optical double with the unrelated [[X Caeli]] (Gamma&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Caeli), a [[Delta Scuti variable]] located {{convert|98.33|pc|ly}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;XSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=X+Cae |title = V* X Caeli – Variable Star of Delta Scuti type|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are a class of short-period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]] and as subjects to study [[astroseismology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delsct|title=Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti Variables|last=Templeton|first=M. |date=16 July 2010|work=Variable Star of the Season|work=AAVSO Website|publisher=[[American Association of Variable Star Observers]]|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; X Caeli itself is also a [[binary star]], specifically a [[contact binary]],&lt;ref name=XAAVSO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=4518 |title=X Caeli |last1=X. |first1=V.

Three other stars in Caelum are still occasionally referred to by their Bayer designations, although they are only on the edge of naked-eye visibility. [[Nu Caeli]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NuAstrostudio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ashland Astronomy Studio: Where Art and Science Converge|title=Nu Caeli (HIP 22488) |url=http://www.astrostudio.org/xhip.php?hip=22488 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another double star, containing a [[white giant]] of magnitude 6.07&lt;ref name=&quot;NuSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+30985 |title = HR 1557 – Star in double system |publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a star of magnitude 10.66 with unknown spectral type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nu2Simbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=CD-41%20%201593B |title = CD-41 1593B – Star in double system |publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is approximately {{convert|52.55|pc|ly}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;NuSimbad&quot;/&gt; [[Lambda Caeli]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LambdaAstrostudio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ashland Astronomy Studio: Where Art and Science Converge|title=Lambda Caeli (HIP 21998) |url=http://www.astrostudio.org/xhip.php?hip=21998 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at magnitude 6.24, is much redder and farther away, being a red giant around {{convert|227|pc|ly}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;LambdaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HR+1518 |title = HR 1518 – Star |publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeta Caeli]] is even fainter, being only of magnitude 6.36. This star, located {{convert|132|pc|ly}} away, is a K-type [[subgiant]] of spectral type K1.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZetaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=zet+Cae |title = Zeta Caeli – Star |publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other twelve naked-eye stars in Caelum are not referred to by Bode's Bayer designations anymore, including RV Caeli.

One of the nearest stars in Caelum is the [[eclipsing binary]] star [[RR Caeli]], at a distance of {{convert|20.13|pc|ly}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRSimbad&quot;/&gt; This star system consists of a dim [[red dwarf]] and a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruch&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/300471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its closeness to the Earth, the system's apparent magnitude is only 14.40&lt;ref name=&quot;RRSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=RR+Cae |title = V* RR Caeli – Eclipsing binary of Algol type (detached) |publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the faintness of its components, and thus it cannot be easily seen with amateur equipment. In 2012, the system was found to contain a [[giant planet]], and there is evidence for a second substellar body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qian&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1745-3933.2012.01228.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is a [[common envelope|post-common-envelope binary]] and is losing [[angular momentum]] over time, which will eventually cause [[mass transfer]] from the red dwarf to the white dwarf. In approximately 9–20 billion years, this will cause the system to become a [[cataclysmic variable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxted&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11564.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep-sky objects ===
Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no [[Messier object]]s. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is [[HE0450-2958]], an unusual [[Seyfert galaxy]]. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magain&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/nature04013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been suggested that the object is an ejected [[supermassive black hole]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahenelt&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1745-3933.2005.00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby [[starburst galaxy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feain&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/518027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antlia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|l|i|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀντλία'') is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name means &quot;[[pump]]&quot; and it specifically represents an air pump. The constellation was created in the 18th century from an undesignated region of sky, so the stars comprising Antlia are faint. Antlia is bordered by [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the sea snake, [[Pyxis]] the compass, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] the sails, and [[Centaurus]] the centaur. This group of constellations is prominent in the southern sky in late winter and spring. [[NGC 2997]], a spiral galaxy, and the [[Antlia Dwarf|Antlia Dwarf Galaxy]] lie within Antlia's borders.

==History==
[[File:Antlia bode.JPG|thumb|border|300px|left|Johann Bode's depiction of Antlia.]]
Antlia was created in 1756 by the French astronomer Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], who created fourteen constellations for the southern sky to fill some faint regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Antlia was technically visible to ancient Greek astronomers, its stars were too faint to have been included in any constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Because of this, its main stars have no particular pattern and it is devoid of bright deep-sky objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;/&gt; It was originally named ''Antlia pneumatica'' (&quot;Machine Pneumatique&quot; in [[French language|French]])&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pasachoff|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |accessdate=3 December 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071218133110/http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm| archivedate= 18 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt; 

Lacaille and [[Johann Bode]] each depicted Antlia differently, as either the single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, or the more advanced double-cylinder version.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations. There is no mythology attached to Antlia as Lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;

According to some, the most prominent stars that now comprise Antlia were once included within the ancient constellation [[Argo Navis]], the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Birren (2002) Objects in the Heavens, pp. 9, 45 (ISBN 155369662X).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Webb (Dover Publications 1962) Celestial objects for common telescopes, Volume 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the faintness and obscurity of its stars, most authorities do not believe that the ancient Greeks included Antlia as part of their classical depiction of Argo Navis.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath (2002) Stars and Planets, pp, 65, 122. (ISBN 0-7894-8988-0)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars===
*[[Alpha Antliae|α Antliae]] is the constellation's brightest star at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.25.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|Tirion|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[M-type star|class M0]] orange [[giant star|giant]] located 366 [[light year]]s away from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;
*[[delta Antliae|δ Antliae]] is a blue [[double star]] 481 light years away. The primary is of magnitude 5.6 and the secondary is of magnitude 9.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;
*[[zeta Antliae|ζ Antliae]] is a wide double star 373 light years away. The primary (ζ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Ant) is of magnitude 5.8, though it is a double star with a primary of magnitude 6.2 and a secondary of magnitude 7.0. The secondary (ζ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ant) is of magnitude 5.9.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:NGC 2997 ESO.jpg|thumb|border|left|300px|A composite image of NGC 2997.]]
Because it occupies a part of the [[celestial sphere]] that faces away from the [[Milky Way]], Antlia contains very few deep-sky objects. It contains no [[globular cluster]]s, no [[planetary nebula]]e, and no [[open cluster]]s. However, it does contain several galaxies. 

[[NGC 2997]] is a loose face-on [[spiral galaxy]] of type [[Galaxy morphological classification|Sc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt; It is the brightest galaxy in Antlia at an integrated magnitude of 10.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt; Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;

The [[Antlia Dwarf]], a 14.8&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy]] that belongs to our [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It was discovered only as recently as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970423.html |title =Antlia: A New Galactic Neighbor |accessdate =9 April 2012 |date=23 April 1997 |publisher = Astronomy Picture of the Day |last = Nemiroff |first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In non-Western astronomy ==
Chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes, and incorporated its stars into two different constellations. Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of &quot;''Dong'ou''&quot;, which represented an area in southern China.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, [[epsilon Antliae]], [[eta Antliae]], and [[theta Antliae]] were incorporated into the celestial temple, which also contained stars from modern [[Pyxis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;

'''Piscis Austrinus''' (also known as '''Piscis Australis''') is a [[constellation]] in the southern [[celestial hemisphere]]. The name is [[Latin]] for &quot;the southern fish&quot;, in contrast with the larger constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which represents a pair of fishes. Prior to the 20th century, it was also known as '''Piscis Notius'''. Its only [[star]] brighter than 4th [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] is [[Fomalhaut]], which is a first-magnitude star and is the 18th brightest star in the night sky.

Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The stars of the modern constellation [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] once formed the &quot;tail&quot; of Piscis Austrinus. In 1597 (or 1598), [[Petrus Plancius]] carved out a separate constellation and named it after the crane.
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Aquarius, Piscis Australis &amp; Ballon Aerostatique.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Piscis Austrinus can be seen cut off at the bottom of ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s 1825 depiction of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. Next to it is the obsolete constellation [[Ballon Aerostatique]].]]
In [[Greek mythology]], this constellation is known as the Great Fish and it is portrayed as swallowing the water being poured out by [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], the water-bearer constellation. The two fish of the constellation Pisces are said to be the offspring of the Great Fish. In [[Egyptian mythology]], this fish saved the life of the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]], so she placed this fish and its descendants into the heavens as constellations of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Origins==

Pisces Austrinus originated with the Babylonian constellation simply known as the Fish (MUL.KU).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Characteristics==
Piscis Austrinus is a constellation bordered by [[Capricornus]] to the northwest, [[Microscopium]] to the southwest, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] to the south, [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] to the east, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] to the north.

[[Fomalhaut]] traditionally represents the mouth of the fish. Its companion [[Fomalhaut b]] was thought to be the first [[extrasolar planet]] ever detected by a visible light image, thanks to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], but infrared observations have since retracted this claim: it is instead a spherical cloud of dust. [[TW Piscis Austrini]] can be seen close by and is possibly associated with Fomalhaut as it lies within a light year of it. Of magnitude 6.5, it is a BY Draconis variable.&lt;ref name=moore11&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Patrick|title=Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|page=472|isbn=0521899354|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=2FNfjWKBZx8C&amp;q=Piscis+Austrinus#v=snippet&amp;q=Piscis%20Austrinus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circinus''' is a small faint [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]], first defined in 1756 by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[compass (drafting)|compass]], referring to the [[Technical drawing|drafting]] tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with [[Pyxis]], a constellation that represents a [[mariner's compass]]) which points north. Its brightest star is [[Alpha Circini]], with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.19. Slightly [[variable star|variable]], it is the brightest [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]] in the night sky. [[AX Circini]] is a [[Cepheid variable]] visible with the unaided eye, and [[BX Circini]] is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two [[white dwarf]]s. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: [[HD 134060]] has two small planets, and [[HD 129445]] has a [[Jupiter]]-like planet. [[Supernova]] [[SN 185]] appeared in Circinus in 185&amp;nbsp;AD and  was recorded by Chinese observers. Two [[nova]]e have been observed more recently, in the 20th century.

The [[Milky Way]] runs through the constellation, featuring prominent objects such as the [[open cluster]] [[NGC 5823]] and the [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 5315]]. Circinus hosts one notable [[spiral galaxy]], the [[Circinus Galaxy]], which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest [[Seyfert galaxy]] to the Milky Way. The [[Alpha Circinids]] (ACI), a [[meteor shower]] also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.

==History==
In 1756, French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] introduced the [[constellation]] of Circinus with the French name ''le Compas'', representing a pair of dividing [[Compass (drafting)|compass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath2&quot;/&gt; It had first been depicted on one of Lacaille's maps in 1754, but it was unnamed.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |pages = 743–47 |title = Guidebook to the Constellations : Telescopic Sights, Tales, and Myths |first = Phil |last = Simpson |isbn = 978-1-4419-6941-5 |publisher = Springer New York |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacaille portrayed the constellations of [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], Circinus and [[Triangulum Australe]], respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level in a set of draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaillenormaetc.htm |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Lacaille's grouping of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe |accessdate=27 June 2012 |work=Star Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/circinus.htm |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Circinus |accessdate=27 June 2012 |work=Star Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Bordered by [[Centaurus]], [[Musca]], [[Apus]], Triangulum Australe, Norma and [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]], Circinus lies adjacent to the [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]] stars. As it is at [[declination]] −50° to −70°, the whole constellation is only visible south of [[latitude]] [[30th parallel north|30° N]].

Sextans as a [[constellation]] covers a rather dim, sparse region of the sky.  It has only one star above the [[apparent magnitude|fifth magnitude]], namely [[Alpha Sextantis|α Sextantis]] at 4.49&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.  The constellation contains a few [[double star]]s, including [[Gamma Sextantis|γ]], [[35 Sextantis|35]], and [[40 Sextantis]].  There are a few notable [[variable star]]s, including [[Beta Sextantis|β]], [[25 Sextantis|25]], [[23 Sextantis]], and [[LHS 292]]. [[NGC 3115]], an edge-on lenticular galaxy, is the only noteworthy deep-sky object. It also lies near the ecliptic, which causes the [[Moon]], and some of the planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time. 

The constellation is the location of the field studied by the [[Cosmic Evolution Survey|COSMOS project]], undertaken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

[[Sextans B]] is a fairly bright [[dwarf irregular galaxy]] at magnitude 6.6, 4.3 million light-years from Earth. It is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=178}}

'''Dorado''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɒ|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|oʊ}} is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the [[coryphaenidae|dolphinfish]] (''Coryphaena hippurus''), which is known as ''dorado'' in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a [[swordfish]]. Dorado is notable for containing most of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], the remainder being in the constellation [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]]. The [[ecliptic pole|South ecliptic pole]] also lies within this constellation.

Even though the name Dorado is not [[Latin]] but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin [[genitive]] form ''Doradus'' when naming its stars; they are treating it (like the adjacent constellation [[Argo Navis]]) as if it were a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like ''Io'' or ''Callisto'' or ''Argo''), names that have a genitive ending in ''-ūs''.

==History==
Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]],{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;!-- Preceding information not sourced to Staal 1988 --&gt; Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603 where it was also named Dorado. Dorado has been represented historically as a [[dolphinfish]] and a [[swordfish]]; the latter depiction is inaccurate.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}} It has also been represented as a [[goldfish]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} The constellation was also known in the 17th and 18th century as '''Xiphias''', the [[swordfish]], first attested in [[Johannes Kepler]]'s edition of [[Tycho Brahe]]'s star list in the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' of 1627. The name ''Dorado'' ultimately become dominant and was adopted by the [[IAU]].

===Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Dorado}}

[[Alpha Doradus]] is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado. [[Beta Doradus]] is a notably bright [[Cepheid variable]] star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. 1040 light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}}

[[R Doradus]] is one of the many [[variable star]]s in Dorado. [[S Doradus|S Dor]], 9.721 [[hypergiant]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], is the prototype of [[S Doradus variable]] stars. The variable star [[R Doradus]] 5.73 has the largest {{as of|1997|alt=known}} apparent size of any star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=r+doradus&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = R Doradus |accessdate = 28 July 2012 |publisher = SIMBAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamma Doradus]] is the prototype of the [[Gamma Doradus variable]] stars.

[[SN1987A|Supernova 1987A]] was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope. [[SNR 0509-67.5]] is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type 1a supernova from about 400 years ago. 

[[HE 0437-5439]] is a [[hypervelocity star]] escaping from the [[Milky Way]]/[[Magellanic Cloud]] system.

Dorado is also the location of the South [[Ecliptic pole]], which lies near the fish's head. The pole was called &quot;Polus Doradinalis&quot; by [[Willem Jansson Blaeu]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Because Dorado contains part of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 1,000 light-years in diameter, is a [[satellite galaxy]] of the Milky Way, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to [[SN 1987A]], the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 25,000 light-year wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} All coordinates given are for Epoch [[J2000.0]].

'''Triangulum''' is a small [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[triangle]]&quot;, derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. The celestial cartographers [[Johann Bayer]] and [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of them [[Bayer designation]]s.

The white stars [[Beta Trianguli|Beta]] and [[Gamma Trianguli]], of [[apparent magnitude]]s 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the yellow-white [[Alpha Trianguli]], of magnitude 3.41, the apex. [[Iota Trianguli]] is a notable double star system, and there are three [[star system]]s with [[exoplanet|planets]] located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] or Messier 33  —a member of the [[Local Group]]. The first [[quasar]] ever observed, [[3C 48]], also lies within Triangulum's boundaries.

==History and mythology==
In the [[Babylonian star catalogues]], Triangulum, together with [[Gamma Andromedae]], formed the constellation known as &lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;APIN ({{cuneiform|𒀯𒀳|lang=sux}}) &quot;The Plough&quot;. It is notable as the first constellation presented on (and giving its name to) a pair of tablets containing canonical star lists that were compiled around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[MUL.APIN]]. The Plough was the first constellation of the &quot;Way of [[Enlil]]&quot;—that is, the northernmost quarter of the Sun's path, which corresponds to the 45 days on either side of [[summer solstice]]. Its first appearance in the pre-dawn sky ([[heliacal rising]]) in February marked the time to begin Spring ploughing in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rogers, John H. |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R |title= Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I. The Mesopotamian Traditions  |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume=108 |year=1998|pages= 9–28|bibcode = 1998JBAA..108....9R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greeks called Triangulum ''Deltoton'' (Δελτωτόν), as the constellation resembled an upper-case Greek letter delta (Δ). It was transliterated by Roman writers, then later [[Latin]]ised as Deltotum.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite book  | last=Allen  | first=Richard Hinckley,  | year=1963 |origyear=1899 | authorlink=Richard Hinckley Allen  | title=[[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]]  | edition=Reprint  | publisher=Dover Publications Inc  | location=New York, New York  | isbn=0-486-21079-0  | pages=414–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eratosthenes]] linked it with the [[Nile Delta]], while the Roman writer [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] associated it with the triangular island of [[Sicily]], formerly known as Trinacria due to its shape.&lt;ref name=ridpathtri&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/triangulum.htm | title=Triangulum |author=[[Ian Ridpath]]|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites two previous sentences --&gt; It was also called ''Sicilia'', because the Romans believed [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], patron goddess of Sicily, begged [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to place the island in the heavens.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt; Greek astronomers such as Hipparchos and Ptolemy called it ''Trigonon'' (Τρίγωνον), and later, it was Romanized as Trigonum.

Later, the 17th-century German celestial cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] called the constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, for the three regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from [[Triangulum Australe]], the Southern Triangle.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt; Polish astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]] excised three faint stars— [[6 Trianguli|6]], [[10 Trianguli|10]] and [[12 Trianguli]]—to form the new constellation of [[Triangulum Minus]] in his 1690 ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'', renaming the original as Triangulum Majus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/triangulumminus.htm | title=Triangulum Minus |author=[[Ian Ridpath]]|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller constellation was not recognised by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) when the constellations were [[Constellation#IAU constellations|established in the 1920s]].&lt;ref name=garfinckle1997&gt;{{cite book | first1=Robert A. | last1=Garfinkle | title=Star-Hopping: Your Visa to Viewing the Universe | publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=1997 | isbn=0-521-59889-3 | page=238 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=40JzBYGREL0C&amp;pg=PA238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer catalogued five stars in the constellation, giving them the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha to Epsilon.

===Deep-sky objects===
The [[Triangulum Galaxy]], also known as Messier 33, was discovered by [[Giovanni Battista Hodierna]] in the 1600s. A distant member of the [[Local Group]], it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough to be seen by the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under [[Light pollution|light-polluted]] skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a [[spiral galaxy]] with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and the [[Milky Way]]. A distance of less than 300 [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawlowski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlowski, Marcel S.; Kroupa, Pavel; Jerjen, Helmut |year=2013|title=Dwarf Galaxy Planes: the Discovery of Symmetric Structures in the Local Group|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|url=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.6210v1.pdf|arxiv=1307.6210|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1384|bibcode = 2013MNRAS.435.1928P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of [[Beta Andromedae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;/&gt; Within the galaxy, [[NGC 604]] is an [[H II region]] where star formation takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960816.html|title=NGC 604: Giant Stellar Nursery in M33 |author=Nemiroff, Robert; Bonnell, Jerry|date=16 August 1996 |work=Astronomy Picture of the Day|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triangulum Australe''' is a small [[constellation]] in the far southern celestial hemisphere. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;the southern triangle&quot;, which distinguishes it from [[Triangulum]] in the northern sky and is derived from the almost [[equilateral triangle|equilateral pattern]] of its three brightest [[star]]s. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted and gave the brighter stars their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756.

[[Alpha Trianguli Australis]], known as Atria, is a second [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] orange [[bright giant|giant]] and the brightest star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two [[A-type main sequence star|white main sequence]] stars [[Beta Trianguli Australis|Beta]] and [[Gamma Trianguli Australis]]. Although the constellation lies in the [[Milky Way]] and contains many stars, [[deep-sky object]]s are not prominent. Notable features include the [[open cluster]] [[NGC 6025]] and [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 5979]].

==History==
Italian navigator [[Amerigo Vespucci]] explored the New World at the beginning of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or [[Apus]]. This was sent to his patron in Florence, [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], and published as ''Mundus Novus'' in 1504.{{sfn|Kanas|2007|pp=118–19}} The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman [[Petrus Plancius]] on a 32½-cm diameter [[globe#Celestial|celestial globe]] published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer [[Jacob Floris van Langren]],{{sfn|Ridpath Star Tales – Triangulum Australe}}&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences--&gt; where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of [[Argo Navis]]. His student [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser|Petrus Keyzer]], along with Dutch explorer [[Frederick de Houtman]], coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=303–04}} Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s celestial atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' in 1603, where it was also given its current name.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=120}}

[[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] portrayed the constellations of [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] and Triangulum Australe as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level respectively in a set of draughtsman's instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars.{{sfn|Ridpath Star Tales – Lacaille}} Also depicting it as a surveyor's level, German [[Johann Bode]] gave it the alternate name of Libella in his ''Uranographia''.{{sfn|Ridpath Star Tales – Triangulum Australe}}

German poet and author [[Philipp von Zesen|Philippus Caesius]] saw the three main stars as representing the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Three Patriarchs]], Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (with Atria as Abraham).{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|p=387}} The [[Wardaman people]] of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the stars of Triangulum Australe as the tail of the [[Rainbow Serpent]], which stretched out from near [[Crux]] across to [[Scorpius]]. Overhead in October, the Rainbow Serpent &quot;gives Lightning a nudge&quot; to bring on the wet season rains in November.{{sfn|Harney|Cairns|2004|pp=156–57}}

==Characteristics==
Triangulum Australe is a small constellation bordered by Norma to the north, Circinus to the west, Apus to the south and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]] to the east. It lies near the Pointers ([[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]]), with only Circinus in between.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=116}} The constellation is located within the [[Milky Way]], and hence has many stars.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=119}} A roughly equilateral triangle, it is easily identifiable. Triangulum Australe lies too far south in the celestial southern hemisphere to be visible from Europe,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=116}} yet is [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] from most of the southern hemisphere.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=119}} The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is &quot;TrA&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 18 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|14|56.4}} and {{RA|17|13.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −60.26° and −70.51°.{{sfn|IAU Constellation Boundary}} Triangulum Australe [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at 9 p.m. on 23 August.{{sfn|James|2011}}

===Bright stars===
In defining the constellation, Lacaille gave twelve stars [[Bayer designation]]s of Alpha through to Lambda, with two close stars called Eta (one now known by its [[Star catalogue#HD/HDE|Henry Draper catalogue]] number), while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=303–04}} The three brightest stars, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, make up the triangle. Readily identified by its orange hue,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=116}} [[Alpha Trianguli Australis]] is a [[bright giant]] star of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] K2&amp;nbsp;IIb-IIIa with an [[apparent magnitude]] of +1.91 that is the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|pp=263–65}} It lies {{Convert|424|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} away and has an [[absolute magnitude]] of −3.68 and is 5500 times more luminous than our sun.{{sfn|Ayres|Brown|Harper|2007}} With a diameter 130 times that of our sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at the centre of our solar system. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation.{{sfn|Kaler, Atria}} [[Beta Trianguli Australis]] is a [[double star]], the primary being a  [[F-type main-sequence star]] with a stellar classification of F1V,{{sfn|Gray et al.|2006}} and an apparent magnitude of 2.85.{{sfn|Nicolet|1978}} Lying only {{Convert|40|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off}} away, it has an absolute magnitude of 2.38.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|pp=263–65}} Its companion, almost 3 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] away, is a 13th magnitude star which may or may not be in orbit around Beta.{{sfn|Kaler, Beta TrA}} The remaining member of the triangle is [[Gamma Trianguli Australis]] with an apparent magnitude of 2.87.{{sfn|Wielen et al.|1999}} It is an [[A-type main sequence star]] of spectral class A1&amp;nbsp;V, which lies  {{Convert|180|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off}} away.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|pp=263–65}}

Located outside the triangle near Beta, [[Delta Trianguli Australis]] is the fourth brightest star at apparent magnitude +3.8.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=116}} It is a yellow giant of spectral type G2Ib-II and lies 606 light years (182 parsecs) away.{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Trianguli Australis}} A [[binary star]], it has a 12th magnitude companion star separated by 30 [[arcsecond]]s from the primary.{{sfn|SIMBAD CPD-63 3854B}} Lying halfway between Beta and Gamma, [[Epsilon Trianguli Australis]] is another double star. The primary component, Epsilon Trianguli Australis A, is an orange [[stellar classification|K-type]] sub-[[giant star|giant]] of spectral type K1.5III with an apparent magnitude of +4.11.{{sfn|SIMBAD Epsilon Trianguli Australis}} The companion, Epsilon Trianguli Australis B (or HD 138510), is a white main sequence star of spectral type A9IV/V which has an apparent magnitude of +9.32,{{sfn|SIMBAD HD 138510}} [[Zeta Trianguli Australis]] appears as a star of apparent magnitude +4.91 and spectral class F9V, but is actually a [[spectroscopic binary]] with a near companion, probably a [[red dwarf]]. The pair orbit each other once every 13 days.{{sfn|Skuljan|2004}} A young star, its proper motion indicates it is a member of the [[Ursa Major moving group]].{{sfn|Croswell|2005}} [[Iota Trianguli Australis]] shows itself to be a multiple star system composed of a yellow and a white star when seen though a 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm telescope.{{sfn|Hartung|1984|p=214}} The brighter star has a spectral type of F4IV and is a spectroscopic binary whose components are two yellow-white stars which orbit each other every 39.88 days. The primary is a [[Gamma Doradus variable]], pulsating over a period of 1.45 days.{{sfn|De Cat et al.|2009}} The fainter star is not associated with the system, hence the system is an [[Double star|optical double]].{{sfn|Hartung|1984|p=214}} [[HD 147018]] is a sun-like star of apparent magnitude 8.3 and spectral type G9V,{{sfn|SIMBAD LTT 6522}} which was found to have two exoplanets, [[HD 147018 b]] and [[HD 147018 c]], in 2009.{{sfn|Ségransan et al. |2010}}

Of apparent magnitude 5.11, the yellow bright giant [[Kappa Trianguli Australis]] of spectral type G5IIa lies around 1207 light years (370 parsecs) distant from our solar system.{{sfn|SIMBAD Kappa Trianguli Australis}} [[Eta Trianguli Australis]] (or Eta1 Trianguli Australis) is a [[Be star]] of spectral type B7IVe which is 661 light years (203 parsecs) from earth, with an apparent magnitude of 5.89.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6172}} Lacaille named a close-by star as Eta as well, which was inconsistently followed by [[Francis Baily]], who used the name for the brighter or both stars in two different publications. Despite their faintness, [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]] upheld their Bayer designation as they were closer than 25 degrees to the south celestial pole. The second Eta is now designated as HD 150550.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=303–04}} It is a variable star of average magnitude 6.53 and spectral type A1III.{{sfn|SIMBAD HD 150550}}

===Variable stars===
Triangulum Australe contains several [[cepheid variable]]s, all of which are too faint to be seen with the naked eye:{{sfn|Klepešta|Rükl|1974|pp=248–49}} [[R Trianguli Australis]] ranges from apparent magnitude 6.4 to 6.9 over a period of 3.389 days, [[S Trianguli Australis]] varies from magnitude 6.1 to 6.8 over 6.323 days, and [[U Trianguli Australis]]' brightness changes from 7.5 to 8.3 over 2.568 days.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=119}} All three are yellow-white giants of spectral type F7Ib/II,{{sfn|SIMBAD R Trianguli Australis}} F8II,{{sfn|SIMBAD S Trianguli Australis}} and F8Ib/II respectively.{{sfn|SIMBAD U Trianguli Australis}} [[RT Trianguli Australis]] is an unusual cepheid variable which shows strong [[absorption band]]s in [[molecule|molecular]] fragments of [[Diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[methylidyne radical|'''⫶'''CH]] and [[cyano radical|'''⋅'''CN]], and has been classified as a carbon cepheid of spectral type R. It varies between magnitudes 9.2 and 9.97 over 1.95 days.{{sfn|Wallerstein et al. 2000}} Lying nearby Gamma, [[X Trianguli Australis]] is a variable [[carbon star]] with an average magnitude of 5.63.{{sfn|SIMBAD X Trianguli Australis}} It has two periods of around 385 and 455 days, and is of spectral type C5, 5(Nb).{{sfn|Tabur|Bedding|2009}}

[[EK Trianguli Australis]], a [[dwarf nova]] of the SU Ursae Majoris type, was first noticed in 1978 and officially described in 1980.{{sfn|Hassall|1985}} It consists of a [[white dwarf]] and a donor star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours.{{sfn|Mennickent|Arenas|1998}} The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an [[accretion disc]] and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet.{{sfn|Gänsicke et al.|1997}} [[Nova Trianguli Australis 2008]] was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.{{sfn|Bianciardi|2009}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Hubble Interacting Galaxy ESO 69-6 (2008-04-24).jpg|right|thumb|[[ESO 69-6]], two merging galaxies with prominent long tails, photographed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]]]
Triangulum Australe has few [[deep-sky object]]s—one open cluster and a few planetary nebulae and faint galaxies.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=119}} [[NGC 6025]] is an [[open cluster]] with about 30 stars ranging from 7th to 9th magnitude.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=119}} Located 3 degrees north and 1 east of Beta Trianguli Australis, it lies about {{Convert|2500|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away and is about {{Convert|11|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}}  in diameter. Its brightest star is MQ Trianguli Australis at apparent magnitude 7.1.{{sfn|Mobberley |2009|p=198}} [[NGC 5979]], a [[planetary nebula]] of apparent magnitude 12.3, has a blue-green hue at higher magnifications, while Henize 2-138 is a smaller planetary nebula of magnitude 11.0.{{sfn|Griffiths|2012|p=262}} [[NGC 5938]] is a remote [[spiral galaxy]] around 300 million light-years (90 megaparsecs) away. It is located 5 degrees south of Epsilon Trianguli Australis.{{sfn|Polakis|2001}} [[ESO 69-6]] is a pair of merging galaxies located about 600 million light years (185 megaparsecs) away. Their contents have been dragged out in long tails by the interaction.{{sfn|Cosmic Collisions Galore!}}

'''Lyra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪr|ə}}; [[Latin]] for [[lyre]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λύρα'')&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M.'' [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]'', Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;1651&lt;/ref&gt; is a small [[constellation]]. It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Its principal star, [[Vega]] ([[Abhijit]] in [[Sanskrit]]), a corner of the [[Summer Triangle]], is one of the brightest stars in the sky. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], [[Vulpecula]], and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;

Lyra is visible from the northern hemisphere from spring through autumn, and nearly overhead, in temperate latitudes, during the summer months. From the southern hemisphere, it is visible low in the northern sky during the winter months.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Lyra}}
Lyra's brightest stars include the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;''Autostar Suite Astronomer Edition''. CD-ROM. Meade, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* α Lyr ([[Vega]]). With an apparent brightness of 0.03m, this is the third brightest star of the northern hemisphere (after [[Arcturus]]) and the fifth brightest star in all; its [[spectral class]] is A0&amp;nbsp;V and it lies at a distance of only 25.3 ly.
* [[Beta Lyrae|β Lyr]] (Sheliak). A group of [[Eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]] is named after this [[variable star]] (3.45m, spectral class B8&amp;nbsp;II), the Beta-Lyrae-stars.
* [[Gamma Lyrae|γ Lyr]] (Sulafat). The main star of this multiple star system is of magnitude 3.24m and spectral class B9&amp;nbsp;III.
* [[Delta1 Lyrae|δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Lyr]]. A double star consisting of a blue-white star of mag. 6m and a semi-regular [[red giant]].
* [[Epsilon Lyrae|ε Lyr]]. A well-known [[quadruple star]], also called &quot;the Double Double&quot; because each of the two brighter components is a double star.
* [[Zeta Lyrae|ζ Lyr]]. Another double star, which can be split using binoculars.
* [[RR Lyrae|RR Lyr]] lends its name to a class of pulsating variable, [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae-stars]].
* [[DM Lyrae|DM Lyr]] is a [[dwarf nova]], namely a close binary consisting of a white dwarf and a low mass star where the former strips off material from the latter, forming an [[accretion disc]] which explodes brightly from time to time.
* [[Kepler-37]] - star with smallest [[extrasolar planet]] known so far (February 2013)
* [[Kepler-62]] - star with a five-planet system discovered by [[Kepler spacecraft]] in April 2013.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Messier 56 HST.jpg|left|thumb|[[Messier 56]] is composed of a large number of stars, tightly bound to each other by gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Collection of Ancient Stars|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1234a/|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lyra are the objects M56, M57, and Kuiper&amp;nbsp;90. [[Messier 56|M56]] is a rather loose [[globular cluster]] at a distance of approximately 32,900 [[light-year]]s, with a diameter of about 85 light years. Its apparent brightness is 8.3m.]]
[[Ring Nebula|M57]], also known as the &quot;Ring Nebula&quot; and NGC 6720,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=123}} has a diameter of one light-year and is at a distance of 2,000 light-years from Earth. It is one of the best known [[planetary nebula]]e and the second to be discovered; its integrated magnitude is 8.8.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; It was discovered in 1779 by [[Antoine Darquier]], 15 years after [[Charles Messier]] discovered the [[Dumbbell Nebula]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=125}} Astronomers have determined that it is between 6,000 and 8,000 years old;&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; it is approximately one light-year in diameter.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=124}} The outer part of the nebula appears red in photographs because of emission from [[ionized hydrogen]]. The middle region is colored green; [[doubly-ionized oxygen]] emits greenish-blue light. The hottest region, closest to the central star, appears blue because of emission from [[helium]]. The central star itself is a [[white dwarf]] with a temperature of 120,000 [[Kelvin]]. In telescopes, the nebula appears as a visible ring with a green tinge; it is slightly elliptical because its three-dimensional shape is a [[torus]] or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] seen from a slight angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found halfway between [[Gamma Lyrae]] and [[Beta Lyrae]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=124}}

[[Gliese 747AB|Kuiper 90]] is also known as 17&amp;nbsp;Lyrae&amp;nbsp;C ([[Gliese 747AB]]), a [[red dwarf]] system near 17&amp;nbsp;Lyrae, but 26 light years from the Sun. Its period is 5 years, and its magnitude is 11.26 in the V band.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;

BD +36 3317 [http://personales.ya.com/casanchi/ast/delta01.htm], a white star in the young open cluster [[Stephenson 1|Stephenson&amp;nbsp;1]], was discovered as a binary eclipsing system by Violat-Bordonau in 2008; its period is 4.30216 days; its other name is VSX J185422.2+365107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Watson, Christopher, Watson |url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=232663 |title=VSX : Detail for VSX J185422.2+365107 |publisher=Aavso.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 6745]] is an irregular [[spiral galaxy]] in Lyra that is at a distance of 208 million light-years. Several million years ago, it [[galaxy merger|collided]] with a smaller galaxy, which created a region filled with young, hot, blue stars. Astronomers do not know if the collision was simply a glancing blow or a prelude to a full-on merger, which would end with the two galaxies incorporated into one larger, probably [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

===Exoplanets===
[[File:Lyra constellation detail long exposure.jpg|thumb|An image showing Lyra]]

[[Exoplanet]]s including [[WASP-3b]], [[HAT-P-5b]], [[GJ 758 b]] and [[GJ 758 c|c]], [[HD 178911 Bb]], [[HD 177830 b]], [[TrES-1]], and [[HD 173416 b]] have been discovered in Lyra. In January 2010 the [[Kepler Mission]] announced the discovery of the additional planets [[Kepler-7b]], [[Kepler-8b]], and three planets around [[Kepler-9]] are expected to be the first of many discovered by the mission, which has a significant part of its field of view in Lyra.

In April 2013, it was announced that of the five planets orbiting [[Kepler-62]], at least two -- [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62f]]—are within the boundaries of the [[habitable zone]] of that star, where scientists think liquid water could exist, and are both candidates for being a solid, rocky, earth-like planet. The [[exoplanets]] are 1.6 and 1.4 times the diameter of [[Earth]] respectively, with their star [[Kepler-62]] at a distance of 1,200 light-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Andrew|title=Most Earthlike planets yet seen bring Kepler closer to its holy grail|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/349783/description/Most_Earthlike_planets_yet_seen_bring_Kepler_closer_to_its_holy_grail|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=ScienceNews.org|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the past, Lyra was often represented on star maps as a [[vulture]] or an [[eagle]] carrying a lyre, either enclosed in its wings, or in its beak. It was sometimes referred to as '''Aquila Cadens''' or '''Vultur Cadens''' (falling eagle or falling vulture).&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;{{cite web |
 title=Star Tales - Lyra | 
 work=Ian Ridpath's Star Tales |
 url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lyra.htm | 
 accessdate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This historical association is preserved in the name of its brightest star, Vega, which is derived from an Arabic term meaning &quot;swooping eagle.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath (2002) Stars and Planets, p. 108 [ISBN 0-7894-8988-0].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|Lyra can be seen on the right of this c. 1825 star map from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.|thumb|left|300px]]
In [[Greek mythology]], Lyra was associated with the myth of [[Orpheus]], the musician who was killed by the [[Bacchantes]]. After his death, his lyre was thrown into the river; Zeus sent an eagle to retrieve the lyre, and ordered both of them to be placed in the sky.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In [[Wales]], Lyra is known as King Arthur's Harp (''Talyn Arthur''), and King David's harp [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Lyra*.html]. The Persian [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] called it the Lyre of Zurah.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Lyra*.html] 
It has been called the Manger of the Infant Saviour, Praesepe Salvatoris [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Lyra*.html].

In Japanese mythology, originating from the Chinese Qixi festival, Vega is sometimes called Tanabata (or Orihime), a celestial princess or goddess. She falls in love with a mortal, Kengyu (or Hikoboshi), represented by the star Altair. But when Tanabata’s father finds out, he is enraged and forbids her to see this mere mortal. Thus the two lovers are placed in the sky, where they are separated by the Celestial River, known to us as Milky Way. Yet the sky gods are kind. Each year, on the 7th night of the 7th moon, a bridge of magpies forms across the Celestial River, and the two lovers are reunited. Sometimes Kengyu’s annual trip across the Celestial River is treacherous, though, and he doesn’t make it. In that case, Tanabata’s tears form raindrops that fall over Japan.

Many Japanese celebrations of Tanabata are held in July, but sometimes they are held in August. If it rains, the raindrops are thought to be Tanabata’s tears because Kengyu could not meet her. Sometimes the meteors of the Perseid shower are said to be Tanabata’s tears.

==Equivalents in other astronomical systems==

Vega and its surrounding stars are also treated as a constellation in other cultures.

In Australian [[Aboriginal astronomy]], Lyra is known by the Boorong people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as the [[Malleefowl]] constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

'''Serpens''' (&quot;the Serpent&quot;, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ὄφις}}) is a [[constellation]] of the northern hemisphere. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and it remains one of the 88 [[modern constellations]] defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, '''Serpens Caput''' (Serpent's Head) to the west and '''Serpens Cauda''' (Serpent's Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of [[Ophiuchus]], the &quot;Serpent-Bearer&quot;.  In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between [[μ Ser]] in ''Serpens Caput'' and [[ν Ser]] in ''Serpens Cauda''. The brightest [[List of stars in Serpens|star in Serpens]] is [[Unukalhai]] or ''Cor Serpentis'' &quot;Serpent's Heart&quot;, with an apparent magnitude of 2.63.

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Taurus Poniatowski, Serpentarius, Scutum Sobiesky, and Serpens.jpg|thumb|left|Serpens held by Ophiuchus, as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825. Above the tail of the serpent is the now-obsolete constellation [[Taurus Poniatovii]] while below it is [[Scutum]].]]
&lt;!-- needs more Greek Mythology --&gt;
[[Aratus]] describes the constellation as follows:
:''Both [hands of Ophiuchus] firmly clutch the Serpent, which encircles the waist of Ophiuchus, but he, steadfast with both his feet well set, tramples a huge monster, even the Scorpion, standing upright on his eye and breast. Now the Serpent is wreathed about his two hands – a little above his right hand, but in many folds high above his left. ... Toward the Crown leans the Serpent’s jaw, but beneath his coiling form seek thou for the mighty Claws [Libra]''&lt;ref&gt;trans. Mair, A. W. &amp; G. R. Loeb Classical Library Volume 129. London: William Heinemann, 1921.[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AratusPhaenomena.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two &quot;serpent&quot; constellations in [[Babylonian astronomy]], known as Mušḫuššu and Bašmu. It appears that Mušḫuššu was depicted as a hybrid of dragon, lion and bird, and loosely corresponds to [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].
Bašmu was a [[horned serpent]] (c.f. [[Ningishzida]]) and loosely corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] on which the  Ὄφις (''Serpens'') of Ptolemy is based.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin White, ''Babylonian Star-Lore'' (2007), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Serpens is unique among the 88 modern constellations in that it is split into two separate parts: ''Serpens Caput'' and ''Serpens Cauda'', the head and tail respectively. The constellation is also one of the only ones that is dependent on another constellation for context; specifically, its being held by [[Ophiuchus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/serpens.htm |title=Serpens |work=Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=self-published |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serpens Caput is bordered by [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] to the south, [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] and [[Boötes]] to the east, [[Corona Borealis]] to the north, and Ophiuchus and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]] to the west; Serpens Cauda is bordered by [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the south, [[Scutum]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] to the east, and Ophiuchus to the north and west. Covering 636.9 [[square degree]]s total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

Serpens Caput's boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a 15-sided polygon, while Serpens Cauda's are defined by a 25-sided polygon. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of Serpens Caput's borders lie between {{RA|15|10.4}} and {{RA|16|22.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between {{dec|25.66}} and {{dec|−03.72}}. Serpens Cauda's boundaries lie between right ascensions of {{RA|17|16.9}} and {{RA|18|58.3}} and declinations of {{dec|06.42}} and {{dec|−16.14}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caelum, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#ser|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation &quot;Ser&quot; for the constellation in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=H. N.| title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 |pages=469–71 |bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Serpens}}

Since Serpens is regarded as one constellation despite being split into two halves, the ordering of [[Bayer designation|Bayer]] and [[Flamsteed designation]]s go roughly in order of brightness among both halves (i.e. there is only one Alpha, one Beta, etc. in the entire constellation). Only one star in Serpens is brighter than third [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]], so the constellation is not easy to perceive.

====Head stars====

The brightest star in Serpens, [[Alpha Serpentis]], also known as Unukalhai, is a [[red giant]] of spectral type K2III located approximately {{convert|22.68|pc|ly}} away which marks the snake's heart. With a visual magnitude of 2.63,&lt;ref name=&quot;AlphaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=alf+Ser |title = * Alpha Serpentis – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eggleton&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13596.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not visible to the naked eye. Located near Alpha is [[Lambda Serpentis]], a magnitude 4.42 star rather similar to the Sun&lt;ref name=&quot;daSilva&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361/201118751}}&lt;/ref&gt; located relatively close to Earth at only {{convert|12.12|pc|ly}} distant.&lt;ref name=&quot;LambdaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=lam+Ser |title = * Lambda Serpentis – Star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beta Serpentis|Beta]], [[Gamma Serpentis|Gamma]], and [[Iota Serpentis]] form a distinctive triangular shape marking the head of the snake, with [[Kappa Serpentis]] being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brighest of the four with an apparent magnitude of 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly {{convert|155.0|pc|ly}} distant.&lt;ref name=&quot;BetaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=bet+Ser |title = * Beta Serpentis – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that a nearby star of magnitude 9.95&lt;ref name=&quot;BetaBSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=bet+Ser+B |title = * Beta Serpentis B – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaya&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1088/0067-0049/192/1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mira variable]] [[R Serpentis]], located between Beta and Gamma, is visible to the naked eye at its maximum brightness of 5.16, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34592 |title=R Serpentis |author=VSX |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type [[subgiant]] located only {{convert|11.25|pc|ly}} distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84.&lt;ref name=&quot;GammaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=gam+Ser |title = * Gamma Serpentis – Variable star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The star is known to show [[solar-like oscillation]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Bi&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/521575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delta Serpentis]], forming part of the body of the snake between the heart and the head, is a multiple star system&lt;ref name=&quot;Malkov&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361/201219774}}&lt;/ref&gt; located {{convert|69.93|pc|ly}} light-years from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth,&lt;ref name=&quot;DeltaSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=del+Ser |title = * Delta Serpentis – Double or multiple star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magntitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light that reaches Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeltaBSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=del+Ser+B |title = * Delta Serpentis B – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary, an white subgiant, is a [[Delta Scuti variable]] with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeltaAAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34969 |title=Delta Serpentis |author=VSX |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located very near Delta, both in the night sky and in actual space at an estimated distance of {{convert|70.87|pc|ly}},&lt;ref name=&quot;16Simbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=16+Ser |title = * 16 Serpentis – Star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[barium star]] [[16 Serpentis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomkin&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/164821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable variable star visible to the naked eye is [[Chi Serpentis]], an [[Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable|Alpha&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Canum Venaticorum variable]] located midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiAAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34972 |title=Chi Serpentis |author=VSX |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two stars in Serpens Caput that form part of the Snake's body below the heart are [[Epsilon Serpentis|Epsilon]] and [[Mu Serpentis]], both third-magnitude [[A-type main-sequence star]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EpsilonSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=eps+Ser |title = * Epsilon Serpentis – Star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MuSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=32+Ser |title = * Mu Serpentis – Star|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an [[Am star]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Adelman&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Mu is a binary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gontcharov&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.newast.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[25 Serpentis]], located a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a [[spectroscopic binary]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrie |first1=R. M. |last2=Phibbs |first2=E. |title=Redetermination of the spectrographic orbits of iot Peg and 25 Ser. |journal=Publications of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory Victoria |volume=8 |page=225 |year=1950 |bibcode=1950PDAO....8..225P}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a hot [[blue giant|B-type giant]] and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a [[53 Persei variable]], which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes&lt;ref name=&quot;25AAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34909 |title=PT Serpentis |author1=VSX |last2=Otero |first2=S. A| |date=10 February 2012 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stars in the head include [[Pi Serpentis|Pi]], [[Rho Serpentis|Rho]], [[Sigma Serpentis|Sigma]], the multiple [[Tau Serpentis|Tau]]s, and [[Omega Serpentis]].

====Tail stars====
[[Image:SerpensCaudaCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Serpens (Cauda) as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
The brightest star in the tail, [[Eta Serpentis]], is similar to Alpha Serpentis' primary in that it is a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit [[solar-like oscillations]] over a period of approximately 2.16 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hekker&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361/200912777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eta Serpentis was previously classified as a [[carbon star]], which would have made it the brightest carbon star in the sky, although this classification was found to be erroneous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antipova&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1134/1.1398919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star system [[59 Serpentis]], also known as d Serpentis, is a triple star system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/144577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary system is a spectroscopic binary consisting of an A-type star and an orange giant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abt&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1088/0067-0049/180/1/117}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the secondary is another orange giant.&lt;ref name=&quot;59BSimbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+169986 |title = HD 169986 – Star in double system|publisher = [[SIMBAD]] | accessdate = 25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system shows [[irregular variable|irregular variations in brightness]] between magnitudes 5.17 and 5.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;59AAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34973 |title=d Serpentis |author=VSX |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stars in the tail include [[Zeta Serpentis|Zeta]], [[Theta Serpentis|Theta]], [[Nu Serpentis|Nu]], [[Xi Serpentis|Xi]], and [[Omicron Serpentis]].

===Deep-sky objects===

====Head objects====

[[Messier 5]] is a [[globular cluster]] located approximately 8° southwest of α Serpentis, right next to the star [[5 Serpentis]], a magnitude 5.05 star which was formerly thought to be variable but is now known not to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;5AAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=34870 |title=MQ Serpentis |author1=VSX |last2=Otero |first2=S. A. |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both designations contain a &quot;5&quot;, this is purely coincidental.

[[Hoag's Object]] is a perfectly shaped [[ring galaxy]] located 600 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.00425). The outer ring is largely composed of young blue stars but the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a [[barred spiral galaxy]] whose arms had a velocity too great to keep its coherence and therefore detached.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[Arp 220]] is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical [[ultraluminous infrared galaxy]], Arp 220 is located 250 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0181). It consists of two large [[spiral galaxies]] in the process of [[galactic collision|colliding]] with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive [[star formation]] throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' [[Active galactic nucleus|core]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[Seyfert's Sextet]] is a group of six galaxies, four of which are [[interacting galaxy|interacting gravitationally]] and two of which simply appear to be a part of the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound [[galaxy cluster|cluster]] lies at a distance of 190 million [[light-year]]s from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0145) and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy clusters known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually [[galactic merger|merge]] to form a large [[elliptical galaxy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tail objects====

Part of the [[Milky Way]] passes through the tail, and thus Serpens Cauda is rich in deep-sky objects. The [[Eagle Nebula]] (IC 4703) and its [[Messier 16|associated star cluster]] lie 7,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the galactic center. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the [[Pillars of Creation]], three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The stars being born in the Eagle Nebula, added to those with an approximate age of 5 million years have an average temperature of 45,000 [[kelvin]]s and produce prodigious amounts of radiation that will eventually [[photoevaporation|destroy]] the dust pillars.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; Despite its fame, the Eagle Nebula is fairly dim, with an integrated magnitude of approximately 6.0. The star-forming regions in the nebula are often [[evaporating gaseous globule]]s; unlike [[Bok globules]] they only hold one [[protostar]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=112-113}}

[[MWC 922]] is a star surrounded by a [[planetary nebula]]. Dubbed the [[Red Square Nebula]] due to its similarities to the [[Red Rectangle Nebula]], the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions. The nebula contains concentric rings, which are similar to those seen in the supernova [[SN 1987A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuthill&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1135950}}&lt;/ref&gt; MWC 922 itself is an [[FS Canis Majoris variable]],&lt;ref name=MWC922AAVSO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=225441 |title=MWC 922 |last1=Plummer |first1=A. |last2=Otero |first2=S. A. |date=27 March 2013 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that it is a [[Be star]] containing exceptionally bright [[hydrogen]] [[emission line]]s as well as select [[forbidden line]]s, likely due to the presence of a close binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=about.vartypes|title=Variable Star Type Designations in the VSX|last1=Otero|first1=S.

The [[Serpens south|Serpens South star cluster]] was uncovered by NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] in the southern portion of the Serpens cloud. The discovery was possible due to the infrared observation capabilities of the SST because at visible wavelengths the stars are completely obscured by interstellar dust in the Serpens cloud.

=== Meteor showers ===
There are two daytime meteor showers that [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiate]] from Serpens, the [[Omega Serpentids]] and the [[Sigma Serpentids]]. Both showers peak between December 18 and December 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesakes==
[[USS Serpens (AK-97)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

'''Cetus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]]. Its name refers to [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a [[sea monster]] in [[Greek mythology]], although it is often called 'the [[whale]]' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:CetusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Cetus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Ecliptic===
Although Cetus is not generally considered part of the [[zodiac]], the [[ecliptic]] passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time.  This is all the more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater [[inclination]] to the ecliptic than the moon and planets. For example, the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]] was discovered in this constellation in 1807.

===Stars===
{{main|List of stars in Cetus}}
The most notable [[star]] in Cetus is [[Mira]] (&quot;the Wonderful&quot;), designated [[Omicron Ceti]], the first [[variable star]] to be discovered and the prototype of [[Mira variable|its class]]. Over a period of 332 days it reaches a maximum [[apparent magnitude]] of 3 - visible to the naked eye - and dips to a minimum magnitude of 10, invisible to the unaided eye. Its seeming appearance and disappearance gave it its common name, which means &quot;the amazing one&quot;. Mira [[pulsating variable|pulsates]] with a minimum size of 400 solar diameters and a maximum size of 500 solar diameters. 420 light-years from Earth, it was discovered by [[David Fabricius]] in 1596.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

There are several other bright stars in Cetus. [[Alpha Ceti|α Ceti]], traditionally called Menkar (&quot;the nose&quot;), is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 220 light-years from Earth. It is a wide [[double star]]; the secondary is [[93 Ceti]], a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.6, 440 light-years away. [[Beta Ceti|β Ceti]], also called Deneb Kaitos and Diphda, is the brightest star in Cetus. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.0, 96 light-years from Earth. The traditional name &quot;Deneb Kaitos&quot; means &quot;the whale's tail&quot;. [[Gamma Ceti|γ Ceti]], Kaffaljidhma (&quot;head of the whale&quot;) is a very close double star. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5, 82 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} [[Tau Ceti]], or Durre Menthor, is noted for being the nearest [[Sun-like star]] at a distance of 11.9 light-years. It is a yellow-hued [[main-sequence star]] of magnitude 3.5.

[[AA Ceti]] is a triple star system; the brightest member has a magnitude of 6.2. The primary and secondary are separated by 8.4 arcseconds at an angle of 304 degrees. The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes in front of the primary and causes the system's apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=67}} [[UV Ceti]] is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two [[red dwarfs]]. both of magnitude 13. One of the stars is a [[flare star]], which are prone to sudden, random outbursts that last several minutes; these increase the pair's apparent brightness significantly - as high as magnitude 7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.jpg|thumb|Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble observes the hidden depths of Messier 77|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1305/|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cetus lies far from the [[galactic plane]], so that many distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] are visible, unobscured by dust from the [[Milky Way]]. Of these, the brightest is [[Messier 77]] (NGC 1068), a 9th magnitude [[spiral galaxy]] near [[Delta Ceti]]. It appears face-on and has a clearly visible nucleus of magnitude 10. About 50 million light-years from Earth, M77 is also a [[Seyfert galaxy]] and thus a bright object in the [[radio spectrum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} Recently, the galactic cluster [[JKCS 041|JKCS&amp;nbsp;041]] was confirmed to be the most distant [[cluster of galaxies]] yet discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists identify new galaxy|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/756711-scientists-identify-new-galaxy|newspaper=Metro|date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 246]] ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 56), also called the Cetus Ring, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.0, 1600 light-years from Earth. Among some amateur astronomers, NGC 246 has garnered the nickname &quot;Pac-Man Nebula&quot; because of the arrangement of its central stars and the surrounding star field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=129}}

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sidney_Hall_-_Urania's_Mirror_-_Psalterium_Georgii,_Fluvius_Eridanus,_Cetus,_Officina_Sculptoris,_Fornax_Chemica,_and_Machina_Electrica.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Cetus dominates this card from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
Cetus may have originally been associated with a [[whale]], which would have had mythic status amongst Mesopotamian cultures. It is often now called the Whale, though it is most strongly associated with [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus the sea-monster]], who was slain by [[Perseus]] as he saved the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Poseidon]]'s wrath. Cetus is located in a region of the sky called &quot;The Sea&quot; because many water-associated constellations are placed there, including [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanus]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], [[Capricornus]], and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cetus has been depicted many ways throughout its history. In the 17th century, Cetus was depicted as a &quot;dragon fish&quot; by [[Johann Bayer]]. Both [[Willem Blaeu]] and [[Andreas Cellarius]] depicted Cetus as a whale-like creature in the same century. However, Cetus has also been variously depicted with animal heads attached to a piscine body.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

===In global astronomy===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Cetus are found among two areas: the [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'') and the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'').

The Brazilian [[Tukano]] and [[Kobeua]] people used the stars of Cetus to create a [[jaguar]], representing the god of hurricanes and other violent storms. Lambda, Mu, Xi, Nu, Gamma, and Alpha Ceti represented its head; Omicron, Zeta, and Chi Ceti represented its body; Eta Eri, Tau Cet, and Upsilon Cet marked its legs and feet; and Theta, Eta, and  Beta Ceti delineated its tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

In [[Hawaii]], the constellation was called ''Na Kuhi'' and Mira (Omicron Ceti) may have been called ''Kane''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Cetus (AK-77)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

'''Vulpecula''' {{IPAc-en|v|ʌ|l|ˈ|p|ɛ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə}} is a faint [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;little [[fox]]&quot;, although it is commonly known simply as the fox. It was identified in the seventeenth century, and is located in the middle of the [[Summer Triangle]] (an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consisting of the bright stars [[Deneb]], [[Vega]] and [[Altair]]).

==Notable features==
[[Image:VulpeculaCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Vulpecula as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
There are no stars brighter than 4th magnitude in this constellation. The brightest star in Vulpecula is [[Alpha Vulpeculae|α Vulpeculae]], a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.44&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[red giant]] at a distance of 297 [[light-year]]s. The star is an [[double star|optical binary]] (separation of 413.7&quot;) that can be split using binoculars. The star also carries the traditional name Anser, which refers to the goose the little fox holds in its jaws.

In 1967, the first [[pulsar]], [[PSR B1919+21]], was discovered in Vulpecula by [[Antony Hewish]] and [[Jocelyn Bell]], in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]]. While they were searching for scintillation of radio signals of [[quasar]]s, they observed pulses which repeated with a [[period (physics)|period]] of 1.3373 [[second]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;hewish&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial origin of the signal was ruled out because the time it took the object to reappear was a [[sidereal day]] instead of a [[solar time|solar day]]. This anomaly was finally identified as the signal of a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]]. Fifteen years after the first pulsar was discovered, the first [[millisecond pulsar]], [[PSR B1937+21]], was also discovered in Vulpecula, only a few degrees in the sky away from PSR B1919+21.&lt;ref name=&quot;backer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = D.

Vulpecula is also home to [[HD 189733 b]], one of the closest extrasolar planet currently being studied by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. On 12 July 2007 the ''Financial Times'' (London) reported that the chemical signature of water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of this planet. Although HD 189733b with atmospheric temperatures rising above 1,000 °C is far from being habitable, this finding increases the likelihood that water, an essential component of life, would be found on a more Earth-like planet in the future.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:M27 - Dumbbell Nebula.jpg|thumb|The Dumbbell Nebula]]
Two well-known [[deep-sky object]]s can be found in Vulpecula. The [[Dumbbell Nebula]] (M27), is a large, bright [[planetary nebula]] which was discovered by the French astronomer [[Charles Messier]] in 1764 as the very first object of its kind. It can be seen with good [[binoculars]] in a dark sky location, appearing as a dimly glowing disk approximately 6 [[arcminutes]] in diameter. A [[telescope]] reveals its double-lobed shape, similar to that of an hourglass. [[Brocchi's Cluster]] (Collinder 399) is an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] formerly thought to be an [[open cluster]]. It is also called &quot;the Coathanger&quot; because of its distinctive star pattern when viewed with binoculars or a low power telescope.

[[NGC 7052]] is an edge-on [[spiral galaxy]] in Vulpecula at a distance of 214 million light-years from Earth. It has a central [[dust lane|dusty]] disk with a diameter of 3700 light-years; there is a [[supermassive black hole]] with a mass of 300 million solar masses in its [[galactic nucleus|nucleus]]. Astronomers surmise that the disk is the remnant of a smaller galaxy that [[galactic merger|merged]] with NGC 7052. [[astrophysical jet|Jet]]s can be seen emanating from the galaxy, and it has very strong [[radio spectrum|radio emissions]]. This means that it is also classified as a [[radio galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|The constellation, under the full name of &quot;Vulpecula and Anser&quot;, can be seen on the bottom of this c. 1825 star map from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.|thumb|300px|left]]
In the late 17th century, the astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]] created Vulpecula. It was originally known as '''Vulpecula cum ansere''' (&quot;the little fox with the [[goose]]&quot;) or '''Vulpecula et Anser''' (&quot;the little fox and the goose&quot;), and was illustrated with a goose in the jaws of a fox. Hevelius did not regard the fox and the goose to be two separate constellations, but later the stars were divided into a separate Anser and Vulpecula. Today, they have been merged again under the name of the fox, but the goose is remembered by the name of the star α Vulpeculae: [[Alpha Vulpeculae|Anser]].

'''Eridanus''' {{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|r|ɪ|d|ən|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]]. It is represented as a [[river]]; its name is the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] name for the [[Po River]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the [[List of constellations by area|sixth largest]] of the modern constellations.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}}

==Notable features==
[[Image:EridanusCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Eridanus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
===Stars===
At its southern end is the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude 0.5]] [[star]] [[Achernar]], designated Alpha Eridani. 144 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white hued [[main sequence]] star whose traditional name means &quot;the river's end&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}} Achernar is a very peculiar star because it is one of the flattest stars known. Observations indicate that its radius is about 50% larger at the equator than at the poles. This distortion occurs because the star is spinning extremely rapidly.

There are several other noteworthy stars in Eridanus, including some double stars. [[Beta Eridani]], traditionally called Cursa, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.8, 89 light-years from Earth. Its place to the south of Orion's foot gives it its name, which means &quot;the footstool&quot;. [[Theta Eridani]], called Acamar, is a binary star with blue-white components, distinguishable in small amateur telescopes and 161 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.3. [[32 Eridani]] is a binary star 290 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is a blue-green star of magnitude 6.1. 32 Eridani is divisible in small amateur telescopes. [[39 Eridani]] is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, 206 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 8. [[40 Eridani]] is a triple star system consisting of an orange main-sequence star, a [[white dwarf]], and a [[red dwarf]]. The orange main-sequence star is the primary of magnitude 4.4, and the white secondary of magnitude 9.5 is the most easily visible white dwarf. The red dwarf, of magnitude 11, orbits the white dwarf every 250 years. The 40 Eridani system is 16 light-years from Earth. [[p Eridani]] is a binary star with two orange components, 27 light-years from Earth. The magnitude 5.8 primary and 5.9 secondary have an orbital period of 500 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}}

[[Image:Jupiter-mass planet orbiting the nearby star Epsilon Eridani.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting the nearby star Epsilon Eridani]]
[[Epsilon Eridani]] is a star with one [[extrasolar planet]] similar to [[Jupiter]]. It is an orange-hued [[main-sequence]] star of magnitude 3.7, 10.5 light-years from Earth.

The [[Eridanus Supervoid]] is the largest [[supervoid]] (an area of the [[universe]] devoid of [[galaxies]]) discovered {{As of|2007|lc=on}}. At a diameter of about one billion [[light year]]s it is much larger than any other known void. It was discovered by linking a &quot;cold spot&quot; in the [[cosmic microwave background]] to an absence of [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]] in data of the [[United States]] [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]'s [[Very Large Array]] Sky Survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2007/coldspot/ NRAO: &quot;Astronomers Find Enormous Hole in the Universe&quot;.] NRAO website, retrieved 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some speculation that the void may be due to [[quantum entanglement]] between [[our universe]] and [[Multiverse|another]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.400-the-void-imprint-of-another-universe.html The void: Imprint of another universe?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6962185.stm Great 'cosmic nothingness' found], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
[[NGC 1535]] is a small blue-gray planetary nebula visible in small amateur telescopes, with a disk visible in large amateur instruments. 2000 light-years away, it is of the 9th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}}

Eridanus contains the galaxies [[NGC 1232]], [[NGC 1234]] and [[NGC 1300]], a grand design barred spiral galaxy.

[[NGC 1300]] is a face-on [[barred spiral galaxy]] located 61 (plus or minus 8) million light-years away. The center of the bar shows an unusual structure: within the overall spiral structure, a [[grand design spiral galaxy|grand design spiral]] that is 3,300 light-years in diameter exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1 = Wilkins |first1 = Jamie |last2 = Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |location = Buffalo, New York |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its spiral arms are tightly wound.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|p=144}}

The name Eridanus refers to the [[Po River]], the main river of northern [[Italy]]. Its association with a river comes from the way its stars trace a tortuous path. In some star maps, Eridanus is depicted as a river flowing from the waters poured by [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. In such maps, Aquarius is visualized as facing Eridanus, requiring a different perspective and a redesign of how the stars of Aquarius connect, so the water pours onto the same side as Eridanus.

==History and mythology==
According to one theory, the Greek constellation takes its name from the Babylonian constellation known as the Star of Eridu (MUL.NUN.KI). [[Eridu]] was an ancient city in the extreme south of Babylonia; situated in the marshy regions it was held sacred to the god Enki-Ea who ruled the cosmic domain of the Abyss - a mythical conception of the fresh-water reservoir below the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 98ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Eridanus is connected to the myth of [[Phaethon|Phaëton]], who took over the reins of his father [[Helios]]' sky chariot (i.e., the Sun),{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}} but didn't have the strength to control it and so veered wildly in different directions, scorching both earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Phaëton dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to earth. The constellation was supposed to be the path Phaëton drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since ''Eridanos'' was also a Greek name for the [[Po (river)|Po]] (Latin ''Padus''), in which the burning body of Phaëton is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Allen, &quot;The River Eridanus,&quot; from ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Eridanus*.html Bill Thayer's edition] at [[LacusCurtius]], with Thayer's [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/home.html cautions on using Allen's work], which is more than a century old. For the mythico-geographical connections of the river and the constellation, see also [[Frederick Ahl]], “Amber, Avallon, and Apollo’s Singing Swan,” ''American Journal of Philology'' 103 (1982) 373–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another association with Eridanus is a series of rivers all around the world. First conflated with the [[Nile River]] in Egypt, the constellation was also identified with the [[Po River]] in Italy. The stars of the modern constellation [[Fornax]] were formerly a part of Eridanus.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|pp=146-147}}

The stars that correspond to Eridanus are also depicted as a river in [[Indian astronomy]] starting close to the head of Orion just below [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. Eridanus is called ''Srotaswini'' in [[Sanskrit]], ''srótas'' meaning the course of a river or stream. Specifically, it is depicted as the [[Ganges]] on the head of [[Dakshinamoorthy]] or [[Nataraja]], a [[Hindu]] incarnation of [[Shiva]].  Dakshinamoorthy himself is represented by the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].

The stars that correspond to Eridanus cannot be fully seen from China. In [[Chinese astronomy]], the northern part is located within the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ''). The unseen southern part was classified among the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on knowledge of western star charts.

==In popular culture==

The game [[Halo (series)|Halo: Reach]] takes place within this constellation—the planet Reach orbits Epsilon Eridani.

In some maps of the [[Star Trek]] universe the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] is shown to be located at '''40 Eridani A'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embracingthenerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Star_trek_map.jpg Map of the full Star Trek Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lacerta''' is one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[lizard]]. A small, faint constellation, it was created in 1687 by the astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]]. Its brightest stars form a &quot;W&quot; shape similar to that of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and it is thus sometimes referred to as 'Little Cassiopeia'. It is located between [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], Cassiopeia and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] on the northern [[celestial sphere]]. The northern part lies on the [[Milky Way]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:LacertaCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Lacerta as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
Lacerta is typical of [[Milky Way]] constellations: no bright [[galaxy|galaxies]], nor [[globular cluster]]s, but instead [[open cluster]]s, for example [[NGC 7243]], the faint [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 5217]] and quite a few [[double star]]s. It also contains the prototypic [[blazar]] [[BL Lacertae]].
Lacerta contains no [[Charles Messier|Messier]] [[Messier object|objects]].

===Stars===
[[Alpha Lacertae]] is a blue-white hued [[main-sequence]] star of magnitude 3.8, 102 light-years from Earth. It has a [[Stellar classification|spectral type]] of A1&amp;nbsp;V and is an optical [[double star]]. [[Beta Lacertae]] is far dimmer, a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 4.4, 170 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=164-165}}

[[Roe 47]] is a multiple star consisting of five components (magnitudes 5.8, 9.8, 10.1, 9.4, 9.8).

[[ADS 16402]] is a [[binary star]] system in Lacerta, around which a [[extrasolar planet|planet]] orbits with some unusual properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/space/15planet.html?ref=spaceandcosmos Puzzling Puffy Planet, Less Dense Than Cork, Is Discovered - New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jupiter]]-sized planet exhibits an unexpectedly low density, about the same as [[cork (tissue)|cork]]. This planet is dubbed [[HAT P-1]].

[[EV Lacertae]] is a rapidly-spinning magnitude 10 [[red dwarf]] with a strong [[magnetic field]]. It is a [[flare star]] that can emit powerful [[Stellar flare|flares]] potentially visible to the naked eye, thousands of times more energetic than any from Earth's sun.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[NGC 7243]] is an [[open cluster]] 2500 light-years from Earth, visible in small amateur telescopes. It has a few dozen &quot;scattered&quot; stars, the brightest of which are of the 8th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=164-165}}

[[BL Lacertae]] is the prototype of the [[BL Lacertae object]]s, which appear to be dim variable stars but are actually the variable nuclei of [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]; they are similar to [[quasar]]s.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=164-165}} It lent its name to a whole type of celestial objects, the [[BL Lacertae object]]s (a subtype of [[blazar]]). The object varies irregularly between magnitudes 14 and 17 over a few days.

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|Lacerta can be seen on the left of this 1825 star map from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''|thumb|300px|left]]
Centred on a region of the sky without apparently bright stars, Lacerta was apparently not regarded as a constellation by ancient Western astronomers. [[Johannes Hevelius]] created the constellation in 1687 and initially christened it &quot;Stellio&quot; (the stellion), a newt with star-like dorsal spots found along the Mediterranean coast. &lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star-names and their meaning, p. 251 (http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/gazetteer/topics/astronomy/_texts/secondary/allsta/home.html).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Europeans who sought to name this new constellation{{dubious|date=February 2014}} included [[Augustin Royer]], who created [[Sceptrum]] (the Hand of Justice and Sceptre) to honor [[Louis XIV]] in 1670, and [[Johann Elert Bode]], who created [[Frederici Honores]] (Frederick's Glory) to honor [[Frederick the Great]] in 1787. Both Sceptrum and Frederici Honores are now [[former constellations|obsolete]], while Lacerta still survives.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=164-165}}

'''Scorpius''', sometimes known as Scorpio, is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[scorpion]], and its symbol is [[Image:Scorpio.svg|15px]] ([[Unicode]] {{unicode|♏}}). It lies between [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] to the west and [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the east. It is a large constellation located in the [[southern hemisphere]] near the center of the [[Milky Way]].

===Stars===
Scorpius contains many bright stars, including [[Antares]] (α Sco), &quot;rival of Mars,&quot; so named because of its distinct reddish hue; [[Beta Scorpii|β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sco]] (Graffias or Acrab), a triple star; [[Delta Scorpii|δ Sco]] ([[Dschubba]], &quot;the forehead&quot;); [[Theta Scorpii|θ Sco]] ([[Sargas]], of unknown origin); [[Nu Scorpii|ν Sco]] (Jabbah); [[Xi Scorpii|ξ Sco]] (Girtab, &quot;the scorpion&quot;); [[Pi Scorpii|π Sco]] (Iclil); [[Sigma Scorpii|σ Sco]] (Alniyat); and [[Tau Scorpii|τ Sco]] (also known as Alniyat, &quot;the arteries&quot;).  &lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 184 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constellations: A Guide to the Night Sky, http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/scorpius-constellation/&lt;/ref&gt;

Marking the tip of the scorpion's curved tail are [[Lambda Scorpii|λ Sco]] ([[Shaula]]) and [[Upsilon Scorpii|υ Sco]] (Lesath), whose names both mean &quot;sting.&quot;  Given their proximity to one another, λ Sco and υ Sco are sometimes referred to as the Cat's Eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Schaaf (Macmillan 1988) 40 Nights to Knowing the Sky: A Night-by-Night Sky-Watching Primer, p. 79 (ISBN 9780805046687).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the bright stars are massive members of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]]: [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association|Scorpius-Centaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Nearest OB Association: Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco OB2)|author=Preibisch, T., Mamajek, E.|year=2009|journal=Handbook of Star-Forming Regions|volume=2|pages=0|bibcode=2008hsf2.book..235P|arxiv=0809.0407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its bright stars form a pattern like a [[longshoreman's hook]].

The star δ Sco, after having been a stable 2.3 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] star, flared in July 2000 to 1.9 in a matter of weeks. It has since become a variable star fluctuating between 2.0 and 1.6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3307781.html?page=1&amp;c=y Delta Scorpii Still Showing Off]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that at its brightest it is the second brightest star in Scorpius.

[[U Scorpii]] is the fastest known [[nova]] with a period of about 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/ AAVSO: Variable Star of the Season: U Scorpii]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omega Scorpii|ω¹ Scorpii and ω² Scorpii]] are an [[optical double]], which can be resolved by the unaided eye. They have contrasting blue and yellow colours.

The star once designated γ Sco (despite being well within the boundaries of Libra) is today known as [[Sigma Librae|σ Lib]]. Moreover, the entire constellation of [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] was considered to be claws of Scorpius (''Chelae Scorpionis'') in [[Ancient Greek]] times, with a set of scales held aloft by [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] (represented by adjacent [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]) being formed from these western-most stars during later Greek times. The division into Libra was formalised during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

===Deep-sky objects===
Due to its location on the [[Milky Way]], this constellation contains many [[deep-sky object]]s such as the [[open cluster]]s [[Messier 6]] (the [[Butterfly Cluster]]) and [[Messier 7]] (the [[Ptolemy Cluster]]), [[NGC 6231]] (by [[ζ² Sco]]), and the [[globular cluster]]s [[Messier 4]] and [[Messier 80]].

[[Messier 80]] (NGC 6093) is a globular cluster of magnitude 7.3, 33,000 light-years from Earth. It is a compact Shapley class II cluster; the classification indicates that it is highly concentrated and dense at its nucleus. M80 was discovered in 1781 by [[Charles Messier]]. It was the site of a rare discovery in 1860 when [[Arthur von Auwers]] discovered the nova [[T Scorpii]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=166-167}}

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Scorpio.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Scorpius as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.]]
In [[Greek Mythology]] the myths associated with Scorpio almost invariably also contain a reference to [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. According to one of these myths it is written that Orion boasted to goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother, [[Leto]], that he would kill every animal on the earth. Although Artemis was known to be a hunter herself she offered protection to all creatures. Artemis and her mother Leto sent a scorpion to deal with Orion. The pair battled and the scorpion killed Orion. However, the contest was apparently a lively one that caught the attention of the king of the gods [[Zeus]], who later raised the scorpion to heaven and afterwards, at the request of Artemis, did the same for Orion to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. There is also a version that Orion was better than the goddess Artemis but said that Artemis was better than he and so Artemis took a liking to Orion. The god [[Apollo]], Artemis's twin brother, grew angry and sent a scorpion to attack Orion. After Orion was killed, Artemis asked Zeus to put Orion up in the sky. So every winter Orion hunts in the sky, but every summer he flees as the constellation of the scorpion comes.

In another Greek story involving Scorpio without Orion, [[Phaethon|Phaeton]] (the mortal male offspring of [[Helios]]) went to his father, who had earlier sworn by the River [[Styx]] to give Phaeton anything he should ask for. Phaeton wanted to drive his father's Sun Chariot for a day. Although Helios tried to dissuade his son, Phaeton was adamant. However, when the day arrived, Phaeton panicked and lost control of the white horses that drew the chariot. First, the Earth grew chill as Phaeton flew too high and encountered the celestial scorpion, its deadly sting raised to strike. Alarmed, he dipped the chariot too close, causing the vegetation to burn. By accident, Phaeton turned most of Africa into desert and darkened the skin of the Ethiopian nation until it was black. Eventually, [[Zeus]] was forced to intervene by striking the runaway chariot and Phaeton with a lightning bolt to put an end to its rampage and Phaeton plunged into the River [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;novareinna&quot;&gt;according to [http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/scorpiolegend.html Scorpio - The Legend and Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The Babylonians called this constellation MUL.GIR.TAB - the 'Scorpion', the signs can be literally read as 'the (creature with) a burning sting'. The Claws of the Scorpion were also known as the Scales in Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008 page 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology===
{{Main|Scorpio (astrology)}}
The Western [[astrological sign]] Scorpio of the [[tropical zodiac]] (October 23 – November 21) differs from the astronomical constellation and the Hindu astrological sign of the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]] (November 16 – December 16). Astronomically, the sun is in Scorpius for just six days, from November 23 – November 28. Much of the difference is due to the constellation [[Ophiuchus]], which is used by only a few astrologers. Scorpius corresponds to the nakshatras [[Anuradha (nakshatra)|Anuradha]], [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshtha]], and [[Mula (astrology)|Mula]].

'''Norma''' is a small and inconspicuous constellation in the southern hemisphere between [[Scorpius]] and [[Centaurus]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[T-square|normal]], referring to a [[surface normal|right angle]], and is variously considered to represent a [[Ruler|rule]], a [[carpenter's square]], a [[set square]] or a [[spirit level|level]].

==History==
Norma, originally named ''l’Equerre et la Regle'' in French, was one of the constellations invented by [[Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Abbé de Lacaille]] in the middle of the 1750s, when he was measuring about 10,000 stars at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/norma.htm |title = Norma |first = Ian |last = Ridpath |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norma represents a carpenter's square, used in the Age of Exploration by carpenters on exploratory vessels.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=254}}

==Notable features==
[[Image:Constellation Norma.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Norma as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
The [[Milky Way]] passes through Norma.

Norma has no α or β star. These are now officially part of Scorpius - [[N Scorpii|N Sco]] and [[H Scorpii|H Sco]] respectively. Norma's brightest star, γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Normae, is only of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.0. Among the constellation's principal stars are the following:

*[[Gamma1 Normae|γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Nor]] and [[Gamma2 Normae|γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Nor]] comprise an easy [[Double star|optical double]]. γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nor is itself a close optical double ([[HJ 4841]]).

*[[Epsilon Normae|ε Nor]]: a relatively fixed [[binary star]] ([[HJ 4853]]). The two components are of magnitude 4.54 and 6.68; the separation is 22&quot; in PA 335°. The fainter component is itself a spectroscopic binary (mag 6.68 and 7.12).

*[[Iota1 Normae|ι&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Nor]]: a multiple star. The AB (mag 5.6 and 5.8) pair comprise a rapid binary with a period of 26.9 years; in 2000 the separation was 0.5&quot; in PA 285°. Component C, of magnitude 8.75, is 11&quot; away in PA 242°; it is not a physical member of the system, being only 55 light-years away, while the AB pair lie at a distance of more than 140 ly.

*[[Mu Normae|μ Nor]] is suspected of being an [[Alpha Cygni variable]], with a range of 4.87–4.98. It is of spectral type O9.7&amp;nbsp;Iab.

*R Normae is a [[Mira variable]]. Its visual range is 6.5–13.9 and its average period is 507.5 days.

*[[S Normae]] is a well-known [[Cepheid variable]] with a range of 6.12–6.77 and a period of 9.75411 days.&lt;ref name=AAVSOS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=19962 |title=S Normae |author =Watson, Christopher |date=4 January  2010|work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the centre of the [[open cluster]] [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 6087.

===Deep-sky objects===
Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many [[deep-sky object]]s, the most notable of which is NGC 6087.

*[[NGC 6067]] is an [[open cluster]], which lies less than 1° north of [[Kappa Normae]]. It contains about 100 stars of the tenth magnitude and has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 5.6m.

*[[NGC 6087]] is the brightest of the [[open cluster]]s in Norma; it lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]] and [[Zeta Arae|ζ Arae]]. It is about 3500 light-years away and contains about 40 stars of the seventh to the eleventh magnitude. Its brightest member is the [[Cepheid variable]] [[S Normae]]. It is of magnitude +5.4.

*[[Shapley 1|Sp 1]] (or PK&amp;nbsp;329+02.1) is a [[planetary nebula]] better known as the ''Fine-Ring Nebula''. It lies about five degrees west-northwest of γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nor, though its actual distance has been variously estimated at 1000–4700 ly. Its integrated magnitude is 13.6 and its mean [[surface brightness]] is 13.9. The central star is a [[white dwarf]] of mag 14.03.

*[[Abell 3627]], also called the Norma Cluster, is a [[galaxy cluster]] located at a distance of approximately 200 million light-years from Earth with a [[redshift]] of 0.016. It is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass, and is thus theorized to be the [[Great Attractor]], a massive object that is pulling the [[Local Group]], the [[Virgo Supercluster]], and the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]] towards its location at 600-1000 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

==History==
A constellation in this area was introduced by [[Isaac Habrecht II]] in his [[celestial globe]] in 1621, who named it ''Rhombus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlascoelestis.com/Bartsch.htm AtlasCoelestis.com: &quot;Jacob Bartsch ― Usus Astronomicus Planisphaerii Stellati Argentoratum (Strasburgo) 1624&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced with a somewhat different constellation by the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in the eighteenth century; during his stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], he named the constellation le Réticule Rhomboide to commemorate the reticle in his telescope eyepiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/reticulum.htm: Ian Ridpath's Star Tales – Reticulum]&lt;/ref&gt; The name was later Latinized to Reticulum in his star catalogue ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum''. In 1810, the stars of Reticulum were used by [[William Croswell]] to produce the constellation ''[[Marmor Sculptile]]'', which represented the bust of [[Christopher Columbus]], but this did not catch on among astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography
 | page=130 | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-387-71668-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation Reticulum became officially recognized during the First General Assembly of the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922. The boundary for this and other constellations was drawn up by Belgian astronomer [[Eugène Delporte]] along arcs of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] for epoch 1875. These were published in 1930 in the ''Delimination Scientifique des Constellations'' at the behest of the IAU.&lt;ref&gt;Kanas (2007:308–309).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Interesting features==

Only two of the stars in this constellation are brighter than [[visual magnitude]] 5: [[Alpha Reticuli|Alpha]] (α) and [[Beta Reticuli|Beta]] (β) reticuli. The reddish star [[R Reticuli]] is a [[Mira variable]]. This variable was discovered by C. Ragoonatha Chary at the [[Madras Observatory]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[binary star]] system [[Epsilon Reticuli]] consists of a [[spectral class]] K2IV star being orbited by a [[white dwarf]]. Based on [[parallax]] measurements, this system is located about 50 [[light year]]s from the Sun. In 2000, a [[extrasolar planet|planetary companion]] was announced, orbiting the star ε Reticuli A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Zeta Reticuli]] is a wide binary star system, with both members being similar to the Sun. It is located at a distance of about 39 light years. This system gained some notoriety in [[ufology]] when the alleged alien abductees [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction|Betty and Barney Hill]] named it as the home of their abductors.

In 2005, a [[type 1a supernova]] was discovered in the spiral galaxy [[NGC 1559]], located in the Reticulum constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6385">All stars but one can be associated with an IAU constellation. IAU constellations are areas of the sky. Although there are only 88 IAU constellations, the sky is actually divided into 89 irregularly shaped boxes as the constellation [[Serpens]] is split into two separate sections, Serpens Caput (the snake's head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (the snake's tail) to the east.

The only star that does not belong to a constellation is the [[Sun]]. The Sun travels through the 13 constellations along the [[ecliptic]], the 12 of the [[Zodiac]] and [[Ophiuchus]].

'''Boötes''' {{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|oʊ|t|iː|z}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° [[declination]], and 13 and 16 hours of [[right ascension]] on the [[celestial sphere]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Βοώτης, ''Boōtēs'', meaning [[herder|herdsman]] or [[plowman]] (literally, ox-driver; from ''boos'', related to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''bovis'', “cow”). The &quot;ö&quot; in the name is a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], not an [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]], meaning that each 'o' is to be pronounced separately.

Boötes was one of the 48 [[constellation]]s described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and is now one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s. It contains the [[List of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the night sky, [[Arcturus]]. Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye.

== History and mythology ==

In ancient Babylon the stars of Boötes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god [[Enlil]], who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers.{{sfn|White|2008|p=207}}

The name ''Boötes'' was first used by [[Homer]] in his [[Odyssey]] as a celestial reference point for [[History of navigation#Antiquity|navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 book 5, 272]&lt;/ref&gt; described as &quot;late-setting&quot; or &quot;slow to set&quot;, translated as the &quot;Plowman&quot;.{{sfn|Mandelbaum|1990|p=103}} Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in [[Greek mythology]] is not clear. According to one version, he was a son of [[Demeter]],&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1996 pp=141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philomenus]], twin brother of [[Plutus]], a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation [[Ursa Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means &quot;ox-driver&quot; or &quot;herdsman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1996 pp=141&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks saw the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] now called the &quot;[[Big Dipper]]&quot; or &quot;Plough&quot; as a cart with oxen.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for &quot;noisy&quot; or &quot;ox-driver&quot;.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the [[plow]] and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=133}}

Another myth associated with Boötes by [[Hyginus]] is that of [[Icarius]], who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by [[Dionysus]]. Icarius made wine so strong that those who drank it appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Icarius's dog, brought his daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and Maera as [[Canis Major]] or [[Canis Minor]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Following another reading, the constellation is identified with [[Arcas]] and also referred to as Arcas and Arcturus, son of [[Zeus]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus' wife, [[Hera]], who was angry at Zeus' infidelity.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} This is corroborated by the Greek name for Boötes, ''Arctophylax'', which means &quot;Bear Watcher&quot;.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Callisto in form of a bear was almost killed by her son who was out hunting. Zeus rescued her, taking her into the sky where she became Ursa Major, &quot;the Great Bear&quot;. The name [[Arcturus]] (the constellation's brightest star) comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;guardian of the bear&quot;.  Sometimes [[Arcturus]] is depicted as leading the hunting dogs of nearby [[Canes Venatici]] and driving the bears of [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1996 pp=141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Boötes as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. In his left hand he holds his hunting dogs, Canes Venatici. Below them is the constellation Coma Berenices. Above the head of Boötes is [[Quadrans Muralis]], now obsolete, but which lives on as the name of the early January [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower. [[Mons Mænalus]] can be seen at his feet.]]

Several [[former constellations]] were formed from stars now included in Boötes. [[Quadrans Muralis]], the Quadrant, was a constellation created near Beta Boötis from faint stars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It was invented in 1795 by [[Jérôme Lalande]], an astronomer who used a [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to perform detailed [[astrometry|astronometric measurements]]. Lalande worked with [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]] and others to predict the 1758 return of [[Halley's Comet]]. Quadrans Muralis was formed from the stars of eastern Boötes, western [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=51}} It was originally called ''Le Mural'' by [[Jean Fortin]] in his 1795 [[Atlas Céleste]]; it was not given the name ''Quadrans Muralis'' until [[Johann Bode]]'s 1801 ''Uranographia''. The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude.{{sfn|Star Tales Quadrans Muralis}} [[Mons Maenalus]], representing the [[Maenalus]] mountains, was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687 at the foot of the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], [[Maenalus]]. The mountain, one of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s hunting grounds, was also holy to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}}

=== Non-Western astronomy ===
The stars of Boötes were incorporated into many different [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese constellations]]. Arcturus was part of the most prominent of these, variously designated as the celestial king's throne (''Tian Wang'') or the Blue Dragon's horn (''Daijiao''); the name ''Daijiao'', meaning &quot;great horn&quot;, is more common. Arcturus was given such importance in Chinese celestial mythology because of its status marking the beginning of the lunar calendar, as well as its status as the brightest star in the northern night sky. Two constellations flanked ''Daijiao'', ''Yousheti'' to the right and ''Zuosheti'' to the left; they represented companions that orchestrated the seasons. ''Zuosheti'' was formed from modern [[Zeta Bootis|Zeta]], [[Omicron Bootis|Omicron]], and [[Pi Boötis]], while ''Yousheti'' was formed from modern [[Eta Bootis|Eta]], [[Tau Bootis|Tau]], and [[Upsilon Boötis]]. ''Dixi'', the Emperor's ceremonial banquet mat, was north of Arcturus, consisting of the stars [[12 Bootis|12]], [[11 Bootis|11]], and [[9 Boötis]].  Another northern constellation was ''Qigong'', the Seven Dukes, which was mostly across the Boötes-Hercules border. It included either [[Delta Boötis]] or [[Beta Boötis]] as its terminus.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The other Chinese constellations made up of the stars of Boötes existed in the modern constellation's north; they are all representations of weapons. ''Tianqiang'', the spear, was formed from [[Iota Bootis|Iota]], [[Kappa Bootis|Kappa]], and [[Theta Boötis]]; ''Genghe'', variously representing a lance or shield, was formed from [[Epsilon Bootis|Epsilon]], [[Rho Bootis|Rho]], and [[Sigma Boötis]]. There were also two weapons made up of a singular star. ''Xuange'', the [[halberd]], was represented by [[Lambda Boötis]], and ''Zhaoyao'', either the sword or the spear, was represented by [[Gamma Boötis]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Two Chinese constellations have an uncertain placement in Boötes. ''Kangchi'', the lake, was placed south of Arcturus, though its specific location is disputed. It may have been placed entirely in Boötes, on either side of the Boötes-Virgo border, or on either side of the Virgo-Libra border. The constellation ''Zhouding'', a bronze tripod-mounted container used for food, was sometimes cited as the stars [[1 Bootis|1]], [[2 Bootis|2]], and [[6 Boötis]]. However, it has also been associated with three stars in Coma Berenices.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Antares had several names that described its significance to indigenous [[Polynesia]]ns. In the [[Society Islands]], Arcturus, called ''Ana-tahua-taata-metua-te-tupu-mavae'' (&quot;a pillar to stand by&quot;), was one of the ten &quot;pillars of the sky&quot;, bright stars that represented the ten heavens of the [[Tahiti]]an afterlife.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=199}} In [[Hawaii]], the pattern of Boötes was called ''Hoku-iwa'', meaning &quot;stars of the frigate bird&quot;. This constellation marked the path for [[Hawaiiloa]] on his return to Hawaii from the South Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=209}} The Hawaiians called Arcturus ''Hoku-lea''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} It was equated to the [[Tuamotu]]an constellation ''Te Kiva'', meaning &quot;[[frigate-bird]]&quot;, which could either represent the figure of Boötes or just Arcturus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=221}} However, Arcturus may instead be the Tuamotuan star called ''Turu''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=264}} The Hawaiian name for Arcturus as a single star was likely ''Hoku-lea'', which means &quot;star of gladness&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=210}} In the [[Marquesas Islands]], Arcturus was probably called ''Tau-tou'' and was the star that ruled the month approximating January. The [[Māori people|Maori]] and [[Moriori]] called it ''Tautoru'', a variant of the Marquesan name and a name shared with [[Orion's Belt]].{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=260}}

== Characteristics ==

Boötes is a constellation bordered by [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the south, [[Coma Berenices]] and [[Canes Venatici]] to the west, [[Ursa Major]] to the northwest, [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] to the northeast, and [[Hercules]], [[Corona Borealis]] and [[Serpens Caput]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Boo'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|13|36.1}} and {{RA|15|49.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates stretch from +7.36° to +55.1°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Boötes}} Covering 907 square degrees, Boötes [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around 2 May and ranks 13th in area.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}

Colloquially, its pattern of stars has been likened to a kite or ice cream cone.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}{{sfn|Polakis|2009}} However, depictions of Boötes have varied historically. [[Aratus]] described him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding the reins of his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Boötes was often depicted standing on the [[Peloponnese]] mountain.{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}} By 1801, when [[Johann Bode]] published his ''Uranographia'', Boötes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The placement of Arcturus has also been mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him. However, [[Germanicus Caesar]] deviated from this tradition by placing Arcturus &quot;where his garment is fastened by a knot&quot;.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

=== Stars ===

{{see also|List of stars in Boötes}}
In his ''[[Uranometria]]'', [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Omega and then A to k to label what he saw as the most prominent 35 stars in the constellation, with subsequent astronomers splitting Kappa, Mu, Nu and Pi as two stars each. Nu is also the same star as Psi Herculis.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=55–57}} [[John Flamsteed]] numbered 54 stars for the constellation.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=355–56}}

[[Arcturus]], or Alpha Boötis, is the brightest star in Boötes and the fourth brightest star in the sky at an [[apparent magnitude]] of −0.04; it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of −0.2. It is also the brightest star north of the [[celestial equator]], barely brighter than [[Vega]] and [[Capella]].{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} Its name comes from the Greek for &quot;bear-keeper&quot;. An [[orange giant]] with color visible from Earth at a distance of 37 light-years, its diameter is 27 [[solar diameter]]s,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} equivalent to approximately 32 million kilometers,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} though its mass is approximately one [[solar mass]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} Its luminosity is 115 [[solar luminosity|L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] and its [[spectral class]] is K2.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} Bayer located Arcturus above the herdsman's left knee in his ''Uranometria''.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}}

Marking the herdsman's head is [[Beta Boötis]],{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} or Nekkar, a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 3.5. Its common name comes from the Arabic phrase for &quot;ox-driver&quot;. It is 219 light-years away{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and has a luminosity of 58 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. Its absolute magnitude is 0.3 and its spectral class is G8.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Eta Boötis]] or Muphrid is a 2.68 magnitude star that is 37 light-years away with a spectral class of G0.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} It has a luminosity of 6.5 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It is the uppermost star denoting the herdsman's left leg.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} Muphrid and Arcturus lie only 3.3 light years away from each other. Viewed from Arcturus, Muphrid would have a visual magnitude of -2½, while Arcturus would be around visual magnitude -4½ when seen from Muphrid.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=136}} [[Gamma Boötis]], or Seginus, is a white star of magnitude 3.03. It is 85 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} Its spectral class is A7,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} and it has a luminosity of 53 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Rho Boötis|Rho]] and [[Sigma Boötis]] denote the herdsman's waist.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} With a visual magnitude of 3.58, Rho has a luminosity of 105 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and is 183 light-years from Earth. Sigma is of magnitude 4.46, with a spectral class of F2 and an absolute magnitude of 3.0. The magnitude 4.05 [[Theta Boötis]] has a spectral type of F7 and an absolute magnitude of 3.8. There are two dimmer F-type stars, magnitude 4.83 [[12 Boötis]], class F8; and magnitude 4.93 [[45 Boötis]], class F5.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Xi Boötis]] is a G8 yellow dwarf of magnitude 4.55, and absolute magnitude is 5.5. Two dimmer G-type stars are magnitude 4.86 [[31 Boötis]], class G8, and magnitude 4.76 [[44 Boötis]], class G0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

Of apparent magnitude 4.06, [[Upsilon Boötis]] has a spectral class of K5 and an absolute magnitude of −0.3. Dimmer than Upsilon Boötis is magnitude 4.54 [[Phi Boötis]], with a spectral class of K2 and an absolute magnitude of −0.1. Just slightly dimmer than Phi at magnitude 4.60 is [[O Boötis]], which, like Izar, has a spectral class of K0. O Boötis has an absolute magnitude of 0.2. The other four dim stars are magnitude 4.91 [[6 Boötis]], class K4; magnitude 4.86 [[20 Boötis]], class K3; magnitude 4.81 [[Omega Boötis]], class K4; and magnitude 4.83 [[A Boötis]], class K1.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

There is one bright B-class star in Boötes; magnitude 4.93 [[Pi1 Boötis|Pi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Boötis]], also called Alazal. It has a spectral class of B9 and is 40 parsecs from Earth. There is also one M-type star, magnitude 4.81 [[34 Boötis]]. It is of class gM0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[File:Celestial photograph of Bootes.jpg|500px|thumbnail|left|Celestial photograph depicting many of Bootes' double and multiple stars. Arcturus is the bright white star in the lower right. The semicircle of stars near the bottom left is the neighboring constellation [[Corona Borealis]].]]
[[Epsilon Boötis]], also known as [[Izar]] or [[Pulcherrima]], is a close triple star popular with amateur astronomers and the most prominent binary star in Boötes. The primary is a yellow-{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} or orange-hued magnitude 2.5 giant star, the secondary is a magnitude 4.6 blue-hued [[main-sequence star]],{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and the tertiary is a magnitude 12.0 star.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The system is 210 light-years away. The name &quot;Izar&quot; comes from the Arabic word for &quot;girdle&quot; or &quot;loincloth&quot;, referring to its location in the constellation. The name &quot;Pulcherrima&quot; comes from the Latin phrase for &quot;most beautiful&quot;, referring to its contrasting colors in a telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary stars are separated by 2.9 [[arcsecond]]s at an angle of 341 degrees; the primary's spectral class is K0 and it has a luminosity of 200 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} To the naked eye, Izar has a magnitude of 2.37.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[Mu Boötis]], known as [[Alkalurops]], is a triple star popular with amateur astronomers. It has an overall magnitude of 4.3 and is 121 light-years away. Its name is from the Arabic phrase for &quot;club&quot; or &quot;staff&quot;. The primary appears to be of magnitude 4.3 and is blue-white. The secondary appears to be of magnitude 6.5, but is actually a close double star itself with a primary of magnitude 7.0 and a secondary of magnitude 7.6. The secondary and tertiary stars have an orbital period of 260 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary has an absolute magnitude of 2.6 and is of spectral class F0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The secondary and tertiary stars are separated by 2 arcseconds; the primary and secondary are separated by 109.1 arcseconds at an angle of 171 degrees.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=106}}

Besides Pulcherrima and Alkalurops, there are several other binary stars in Boötes:
* [[Delta Boötis]] is a wide double star with a primary of magnitude 3.5 and a secondary of magnitude 7.8. The primary is a yellow giant of spectral class class G8 117 light-years away and the secondary is a white star;{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} like Beta, the primary has a luminosity of 58 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. To the naked eye, Delta Boötis appears as a star of magnitude 3.47.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} 
* [[Iota Bootis]] is a triple star with a primary of magnitude 4.8 and spectral class of A7,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} a secondary of magnitude 7.5,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and a tertiary of magnitude 12.6.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The primary is 97 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary stars are separated by 38.5 arcseconds, at an angle of 33 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The primary and tertiary stars are separated by 86.7 arcseconds at an angle of 194 degrees. Both the primary and tertiary appear white in a telescope, but the secondary appears yellow-hued.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}}
* [[Kappa Bootis]] is another wide double star. The primary is 155 light-years away and has a magnitude of 4.5. The secondary is 196 light-years away and has a magnitude of 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The two components are separated by 13.4 arcseconds, at an angle of 236 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The primary, with spectral class A7, appears white and the secondary appears bluish.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}}
* [[Nu Boötis]] is a binocular binary star. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.0. The primary is 870 light-years away and the secondary is 430 light-years. [[Xi Bootis]] is a quadruple star popular with amateur astronomers. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 4.7 and the secondary is an orange star of magnitude 6.8. The system is 22 light-years away and has an orbital period of 150 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary have a separation of 6.7 arcseconds at an angle of 319 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The tertiary is a magnitude 12.6 star (though it may be observed to be brighter) and the quaternary is a magnitude 13.6 star.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} 
* [[Pi Bootis|π Boo]] is a close triple star. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.9, the secondary is a blue-white star of magnitude 5.8,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 10.4.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The primary and secondary components are separated by 5.6 arcseconds at an angle of 108 degrees;{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} the primary and tertiary components are separated by 128 arcseconds at an angle of 128 degrees.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}}
* [[Zeta Boötis]] is a triple star that consists of a [[binary star|physical binary]] pair with an [[double star|optical]] companion. Lying 205 light-years away from Earth, The physical pair has a period of 123.3 years and consists of a magnitude 4.5 and a magnitude 4.6 star. The two components are separated by 1.0 arcseconds at an angle of 303 degrees. The optical companion is of magnitude 10.9, separated by 99.3 arcseconds at an angle of 259 degrees. [[44 Boötis]] is an eclipsing variable star. The primary is of variable magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude 6.2; they have an orbital period of 225 years. The components are separated by 1.0 arcseconds at an angle of 40 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

==== Variable stars ====

Boötes possesses several variable stars. [[T Boötis]] was a [[nova]] observed in April 1860 at a magnitude of 9.7. It has never been observed since, but that does not preclude the possibility of it being a highly irregular [[variable star]] or a [[recurrent nova]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}}

Two of the brighter Mira-type variables stars in the constellations are R Bo[[R Boötis|ö]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;tis and S Bo[[R Boötis|ö]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;tis. [[R Boötis]] is an M-type star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.1 to a maximum of 6.2 over a period of 223.4 days.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[S Boötis]] is another M-type Mira variable that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.8 to a maximum of 7.8 over a period of 270.7 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[44 Boötis]] (i Boötis) is a double variable star 42 light-years away. It has an overall magnitude of 4.8 and appears yellow to the naked eye. The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1; their orbital period is 220 years. The secondary is itself an eclipsing variable star with a range of 0.6 magnitudes; its orbital period is 6.4 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} It is a [[W Ursae Majoris variable]] that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 7.1 to a maximum of 6.5 every 0.27 days. Both stars are G-type stars. Another W UMa-type star is [[ZZ Boötis]], which has two G2-type components and ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 6.4 to a maximum of 5.8. It has a period of 5.0 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

Boötes has two [[semi-regular variable star]]s. [[V Boötis]] is an M-type star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 12.0 to a maximum of 7.0, over a period of 258 days. [[W Boötis]] is a brighter M-type star; it has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.7, with a period of 450 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[BL Boötis]] is the prototype of its class of pulsating variable stars,{{sfn|North|2004|p=123}} the [[anomalous Cepheids]]. These stars are somewhat similar to [[Cepheid variable]]s, but they do not have the same relationship between their period and luminosity.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=61}} Their periods are similar to [[RRAB variable]]s; however, they are far brighter than these stars.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=69}} BL Boötis is a member of the cluster [[NGC 5466]]. Anomalous Cepheids are [[metallicity|metal poor]] and have masses not much larger than the Sun's, on average, 1.5 [[solar mass]]es. BL Boötis type stars are a subtype of [[RR Lyrae]] variables.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=70}}

An apparent magnitude 4.18 [[Ap and Bp stars|type A0p star]],{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Lambda Boötis]] is the prototype of a class of chemically peculiar stars, only some of which pulsate as [[Delta Scuti]] type stars. The distinction between the Lambda Boötis stars as a class of stars with peculiar spectra, and the delta Scuti stars whose class describes pulsation in low-overtone pressure modes, is an important one. While many Lambda Boötis stars pulsate and are delta Scuti stars, not many delta Scuti stars have Lambda Boötis peculiarities, since the Lambda Boötis stars are a much rarer class whose members can be found both inside and outside the delta Scuti instability strip. Lambda Boötis stars are [[dwarf star]]s that can be either spectral class A or F.{{sfn|North|2004|p=145}} Like BL Boötis-type stars they are metal-poor.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=62}} Scientists have had difficulty explaining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis stars, partly because only around 60 confirmed members exist, but also due to heterogeneity in the literature. Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

==== Stars with planetary systems ====

[[File:Tau Bootis Ab.jpg|thumb|left|A digital rendering of Tau Boötis b]]

[[Extrasolar planet]]s have been discovered encircling ten stars in Boötes as of 2012. [[Tau Boötis]] is orbited by a large planet, discovered in 1999. The host star itself is a magnitude 4.5 star of type F7V, 15.6 [[parsec]]s from Earth. It has a mass of 1.3 [[solar mass]]es and a radius of 1.331 [[solar radius|solar radii]]; a companion, [[GJ527B]], orbits at a distance of 240 AU. [[Tau Boötis b]], the sole planet discovered in the system, orbits at a distance of 0.046 AU every 3.31 days. Discovered through [[radial velocity]] measurements, it has a mass of 5.95 [[Jupiter mass]]es.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia Tau Boo b}} This makes it a [[hot Jupiter]].{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} The host star and planet are [[tidal lock|tidally locked]], meaning that the planet's orbit and the star's particularly high rotation are synchronized.{{sfn|Cameron et al. 2000}}{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} Furthermore, a slight variability in the host star's light may be caused by magnetic interactions with the planet.{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} [[Carbon monoxide]] is present in the planet's atmosphere. Tau Boötis b does not [[astronomical transit|transit]] its star, rather, its orbit is inclined 46 degrees.{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} Like Tau Boötis b, [[HAT-P-4 b]] is also a hot Jupiter. It is noted for orbiting a particularly [[metallicity|metal-rich]] host star and being of low density.{{sfn|Kovács et al.|2007}} Discovered in 2007, HAT-P-4 b has a mass of 0.68 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.27 Jupiter radii. It orbits every 3.05 days at a distance of 0.04 AU. [[HAT-P-4]], the host star, is an F-type star of magnitude 11.2, 310 parsecs from Earth. It is larger than the Sun, with a mass of 1.26 solar masses and a radius of 1.59 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HAT-P-4 b}}

[[File:Hd128311.png|thumb|right|Evolution of the HD 128311 system over time]]

Boötes is also home to multiple-planet systems. [[HD 128311]] is the host star for a two-planet system, consisting of [[HD 128311 b]] and [[HD 128311 c]], discovered in 2002 and 2005, respectively.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} HD 128311 b is the smaller planet, with a mass of 2.18 Jupiter masses; it was discovered through [[radial velocity]] observations. It orbits at almost the same distance as Earth, at 1.099 AU; however, its orbital period is significantly longer at 448.6 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}} The larger of the two, HD 128311 c, has a mass of 3.21 Jupiter masses and was discovered in the same manner. It orbits every 919 days inclined at 50°, and is 1.76 AU from the host star.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} The host star, HD 128311, is a K0V-type star located 16.6 parsecs from Earth. It is smaller than the Sun, with a mass of 0.84 solar masses and a radius of 0.73 solar radii; it also appears below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at an apparent magnitude of 7.51.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}

There are several single-planet systems in Boötes. [[HD 132406]] is a sun-like star of spectral type G0V with an apparent magnitude of 8.45, 231.5 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} It has a mass of 1.09 solar masses and a radius of 1 solar radius.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} The star is orbited by a gas giant, [[HD 132406 b]], discovered in 2007.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} HD 132406 orbits 1.98 AU from its host star with a period of 974 days and has a mass of 5.61 Jupiter masses. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} [[WASP-23]] is a star with one orbiting planet, [[WASP-23 b]]. The planet, discovered by the [[transit method]] in 2010, orbits every 2.944 very close to its sun, at 0.0376 AU. It is smaller than Jupiter, at 0.884 Jupiter masses and 0.962 Jupiter radii. Its star is a K1V type star of apparent magnitude 12.7, far below naked-eye visibility, and smaller than the Sun at 0.78 solar masses and 0.765 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-23 b}} [[HD 131496]] is also encircled by one planet, [[HD 131496 b]]. The star is of type K0 and is located 110 parsecs from Earth; it appears at a visual magnitude of 7.96. It is significantly larger than the Sun, with a mass of 1.61 solar masses and a radius of 4.6 solar radii. Its one planet, discovered in 2011 by the [[radial velocity method]], has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses; its radius is as yet undetermined. HD 131496 b orbits at a distance of 2.09 AU with a period of 883 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 131496 b}}

Another single planetary system in Boötes is the [[HD 132563]] system, a [[triple star]] system. The parent star, technically [[HD 132563B]], is a star of magnitude 9.47, 96 parsecs from Earth. It is almost exactly the size of the sun, with the same radius and a mass only 1% greater. Its planet, [[HD 132563B b]], was discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method. 1.49 times the mass of Jupiter, it orbits 2.62 AU from its star with a period of 1544 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132563B b}} Its orbit is somewhat elliptical, with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.22. HD 132563B b is one of very few planets found in triple star systems; it orbits the isolated member of the system, which is separated from the other components, a [[spectroscopic binary]], by 400 AU.{{sfn|Desidera et al.|2011}} Also discovered through the radial velocity method, albeit a year earlier, is [[HD 136418 b]], a 2-Jupiter mass planet that orbits the star [[HD 136418]] at a distance of 1.32 AU with a period of 464.3 days. Its host star is a magnitude 7.88 G5-type star, 98.2 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of 3.4 solar radii and a mass of 1.33 solar masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 136418 b}}

[[WASP-14 b]] is one of the most massive and dense exoplanets known,{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} with a mass of 7.341 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.281 Jupiter radii. Discovered via the transit method, it orbits 0.036 AU from its host star with a period of 2.24 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} WASP-14 b has a density of 4.6 grams per cubic centimeter, making it one of the densest exoplanets known.{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} Its host star, [[WASP-14]], is an F5V-type star of magnitude 9.75, 160 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of 1.306 solar radii and a mass of 1.211 solar masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} It also has a very high proportion of [[lithium]].{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

Boötes is in a part of the [[celestial sphere]] facing away from the plane of our home [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright [[globular cluster]] and many faint [[galaxy|galaxies]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} The globular cluster [[NGC 5466]] has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated [[open cluster]] in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a [[Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class]] 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=103}} Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low [[surface brightness]], so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=104}}

Boötes has two bright galaxies. [[NGC 5248]] ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 45) is a [[Hubble sequence|type Sc galaxy]] (a variety of [[spiral galaxy]]) of magnitude 10.2. It measures 6.5 by 4.9 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} 50 million light-years from Earth, NGC 5248 is a member of the [[Virgo Cluster]] of galaxies; it has dim outer arms and obvious [[H II region]]s, [[dust lane]]s, and young [[star cluster]]s.{{sfn|Niksch|Block|2004}} [[NGC 5676]] is another type Sc galaxy of magnitude 10.9. It measures 3.9 by 2.0 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Other galaxies include [[NGC 5008]], a type Sc [[emission-line galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5008}} [[NGC 5548]], a type S [[Seyfert galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5548}} [[NGC 5653]], a type S HII galaxy,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5653}} [[NGC 5778]] (also classified as NGC 5825),{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5825}} a type E galaxy that is the brightest of its cluster,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5778}} [[NGC 5886]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5886}} and [[NGC 5888]], a type SBb galaxy.{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5888}} [[NGC 5698]] is a barred spiral galaxy, notable for being the host of the 2005 supernova [[SN 2005bc]], which peaked at magnitude 15.3.

Much further away lies the 250 million light-year diameter [[Boötes void]], a huge space largely empty of galaxies. Its centre is roughly 700 million light years from Earth. Beyond it and within the bounds of the constellation, lie two [[supercluster]]s at around 830 million and 1 billion light years distant.

=== Meteor showers ===
[[File:Quad2011.324.JPG|thumb|left|A Quadrantid captured by an all-sky camera during a 4-second exposure.]]
Boötes is home to the [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower, the most prolific annual meteor shower. It was discovered in January 1835 and named in 1864 by Alexander Hershell.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} The [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is located in northern Boötes near Kappa Boötis,{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=612}} in its namesake former constellation of [[Quadrans Muralis]]. Quadrantid meteors are dim, but have a peak visible hourly rate of approximately 100 per hour on January 3–4.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} The [[zenithal hourly rate]] of the Quadrantids is approximately 130 meteors per hour at their peak; it is also a very narrow shower. The Quadrantids are notoriously difficult to observe because of a low radiant and often inclement weather. The parent body of the meteor shower has been disputed for decades;{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} however, [[Peter Jenniskens]] has proposed [[2003 EH1|2003 EH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], a minor planet, as the parent.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=368}} 2003 EH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may be linked to [[C/1490 Y1|C/1490 Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], a comet previously thought to be a potential parent body for the Quadrantids.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=373}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=376}} 2003 EH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[short-period comet]] of the [[Jupiter family comet|Jupiter family]]; 500 years ago, it experienced a catastrophic breakup event. It is now dormant.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}} The Quadrantids had notable displays in 1982, 1985, and 2004.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=49}} Meteors from this shower often appear to have a blue hue and travel at a moderate speed of 41.5–43 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=104}}

On April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid [[Alpha Bootids]] was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6&amp;nbsp;cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near [[Arcturus]] with a diameter of less than 1°. [[Peter Jenniskens]] comments that this outburst resembled a &quot;typical dust trail crossing&quot;.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=199}} The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27th and 28th, and finishing on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second.{{sfn|IAU Alpha Bootids}} They may be related to Comet [[73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3]], but this connection is only theorized.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}}

[[File:QUADRANTID meteor on January 3 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A bright Quadrantid observed at twilight.]]

The [[June Bootids]], also known as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower associated with the comet [[7P/Pons-Winnecke]], first recognized on May 27, 1916 by William F. Denning.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=334}} The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because Earth did not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 [[astronomical unit|AU]] of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed. In 1982, E. A. Reznikov discovered that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=335}} Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit was not in a favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of meteors radiating from Boötes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest meteors lasting several seconds at times. Many [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s, green-hued trails, and even some meteors that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200–300 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=336–337}} In 2002, two Russian astronomers determined that material ejected from the comet in 1825 was responsible for the 1998 outburst.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=338}} [[Ejecta]] from the comet dating to 1819, 1825, and 1830 was predicted to enter Earth's atmosphere on June 23, 2004. The predictions of a shower less spectacular than the 1998 showing were borne out in a display that had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 16–20 meteors per hour that night. The June Bootids are not expected to have another outburst in the next 50 years.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=339–344}} Typically, only 1–2 dim, very slow meteors are visible per hour; the average June Bootid has a magnitude of 5.0. It is related to the [[Alpha Draconids]] and the [[Bootids-Draconids]]. The shower lasts from June 27 to July 5, with a peak on the night of June 28.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=113}} The June Bootids are classified as a class III shower (variable),{{sfn|AMS 2012 List}} and has an average entry velocity of 18 kilometers per second. Its radiant is located 7 degrees north of Beta Boötis.{{sfn|AMS June 23}}

The [[Beta Bootids]] is a weak shower that begins on January 5, peaks on January 16, and ends on January 18. Its meteors travel at 43 kilometers/second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=105}} The [[January Bootids]] is a short, young meteor shower that begins on January 9, peaks from January 16 to January 18, and ends on January 18th.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Phi Bootids]] is another weak shower radiating from Boötes. It begins on April 16, peaks on April 30 and May 1, and ends on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 15.1&amp;nbsp;km/s. They were discovered in 2006.{{sfn|IAU Phi Bootids}}  The shower's peak hourly rate can be as high as 6 meteors per hour. Though named for a star in Boötes, the Phi Bootid radiant has moved into [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].{{sfn|Koed|Sherrod|2003|p=52}} The meteor stream is associated with three different asteroids: [[1620 Geographos]], [[2062 Aten]], and [[1978 CA]].{{sfn|Štohl|Porubčan|1993|p=43}} The [[Lambda Bootids]], part of the [[Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex]], are a weak annual shower with moderately fast meteors; 41.75&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Lambda Bootids}} The complex includes the Lambda Bootids, as well as the [[Theta Coronae Borealids]] and [[Xi Coronae Borealids]].{{sfn|IAU Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex}}{{sfn|Green|2007}} All of the Bootid-Coronae Borealid showers are [[Jupiter family comet]] showers; the streams in the complex have highly inclined orbits.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}}

There are several minor showers in Boötes, some of whose existence is yet to be verified. The [[Rho Bootids]] radiate from near the namesake star, and were hypothesized in 2010.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}} The average Rho Bootid has an entry velocity of 43&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}}{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} It peaks in November and lasts for 3 days. The Rho Bootid shower is part of the [[SMA complex]], a group of meteor showers related to the [[Taurids]], which is in turn linked to the comet [[2P/Encke]]. However, the link to the Taurid shower remains unconfirmed and may be a chance correlation.{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} Another such shower is the [[Gamma Bootids]], which were hypothesized in 2006. Gamma Bootids have an entry velocity of 50.3&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Gamma Bootids}} The [[Nu Bootids]], hypothesized in 2012, have faster meteors, with an entry velocity of 62.8&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Nu Bootids}}

'''Scutum''' is a small [[constellation]] introduced in the seventeenth century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[shield]].

==History==
[[Image:ScutumCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Scutum as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
[[Image:Scutum Sobiescianum.PNG|thumb|left|200px|''Scutum Sobiescianum'' ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' 1690]]
[[File:POL COA Janina.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[Janina Coat of Arms|The shield of Sobieski]] - heraldry]]

Scutum was created in 1684 by Polish astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/scutum.htm Star Tales ― Scutum] by [[Ian Ridpath]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Jan Heweliusz), who originally named it '''Scutum Sobiescianum''' (Shield of Sobieski) to commemorate the victory of the Polish forces led by King [[John III Sobieski]] (Jan III Sobieski) in the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683. Later, the name was shortened to Scutum.

Five bright stars of Scutum ([[Alpha Scuti|α Sct]], [[Beta Scuti|β Sct]], [[Delta Scuti|δ Sct]], [[Epsilon Scuti|ε Sct]] and [[Eta Scuti|η Sct]]) were previously known as 1, 6, 2, 3, and 9 Aquilae respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Wagman | first=M.
 | title=Flamsteed's Missing Stars
 | journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.18, NO. 3/AUG, P.209, 1987
 | volume=18 | pages=212–213 |date=August 1987
 | bibcode=1987JHA....18..209W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, the Chinese also identified these stars with battle armor, incorporating them into the larger [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as ''Tien Pien'', i.e., the Heavenly Casque (or Helmet).&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names and Their Meanings, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==

===Stars===
Scutum is not a bright constellation, with the brightest star, [[Alpha Scuti]], at magnitude 3.85. But some stars are notable in the constellation. [[Beta Scuti]] is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by [[Delta Scuti]] at magnitude 4.72. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type resembling to the Sun, although it's 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is now coming at the direction of the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it will come as close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than [[Sirius]] by that time.

Scutum is also notable for having [[UY Scuti]], a red supergiant pulsating variable star. At 1,708 ± 192 solar radii, it is the [[List of largest known stars|largest star currently known]].

===Deep sky objects===

Although not a large constellation, Scutum contains several [[open cluster]]s, as well as a [[globular cluster]] and a [[planetary nebula]]. The two best known [[deep sky object]]s in Scutum are [[Wild Duck Cluster|M11]] (the Wild Duck Cluster) and the open cluster [[Open Cluster M26|M26]] (NGC 6694). The globular cluster [[NGC 6712]] and the planetary nebula [[IC 1295]]
can be found in the eastern part of the constellation, only 24 arcminutes apart.

The most prominent open cluster in Scutum is the Wild Duck Cluster, M11. It was named by [[William H. Smyth]] in 1844 for its resemblance in the eyepiece to a flock of ducks in flight. The cluster, 6200 light-years from Earth and 20 light-years in diameter, contains approximately 3000 stars, making it a particularly rich cluster. It is 220 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = So, Where Are the Wild Ducks?! |last = MacRobert |first = Alan |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space Exploration ==
The [[Space probe]] [[Pioneer 11]] is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be long dead.

'''Apus''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means &quot;no feet&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]], and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (which were once believed to lack feet). It is bordered by [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]], [[Musca]], [[Chamaeleon]], [[Octans]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]]. Its [[genitive]] is &quot;Apodis&quot;.

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35&amp;nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=76-77}}&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.universetoday.com/19562/apus/ |title = Apus |last = Plotner |first = Tammy |publisher = Universe Today |date = 13 October 2008 |accessdate = 22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plancius called the constellation ''&quot;Paradysvogel Apis Indica&quot;''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'bird of paradise,' of genus [[Pteridophora]], but the others are [[Latin]] for &quot;Indian Bee,&quot; although &quot;apis&quot; (Latin for &quot;bee&quot;) is presumably an error for &quot;avis&quot; or &quot;bird&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm |title = Apus |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;/&gt;

The name &quot;Apus&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;apous&quot;, meaning &quot;without feet&quot;, which referred to the Western conception of a bird-of-paradise as one without feet, a misconception perpetuated by the fact that the only specimens available in the West had both feet and wings removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; These specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition brought them home.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=252}}

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the first known depiction of the constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, where it was called &quot;Apis Indica&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;/&gt;

It was suggested by Richard Allen that Houtmann, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Indus_(constellation)|Indus]]) from the Chinese, who knew these stars as the &quot;Little Wonder Bird.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, p. 43 &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Apus*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Ridpath, however, disputes this possibility, arguing that the southern constellations were introduced later than Allen believed, and by different people altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Constellation Apus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Apus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
The most prominent deep-sky objects in Apus include the globular clusters [[NGC 6101]] and IC 4499 as well as the spiral galaxy IC 4633.

'''Crater''' is a [[constellation]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[cup]], and in [[Greek mythology]] it is identified with the cup of the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is faint, with no [[star]] brighter than third [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]].

==Notable features==

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Uraniæ, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Corvus, Crater and other constellations seen around [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]]. From ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Crater is identified with a story from [[Greek mythology]] in which a [[crow]] or [[raven]] serves [[Apollo]], and is sent to fetch water, but it rests lazily on the journey, and after finally obtaining the water in a cup, takes back a water snake as an excuse. According to the myth, Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake, into the sky. The constellations of [[Corvus (constellation)|Corvus]] the crow and [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the water-snake are also identified with this myth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|p=128}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Crater are located within the constellation of  the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0605/ap060531.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 5 月 31 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Society Islands]], Crater was recognized as a constellation called ''Moana-ohu-noa-ei-haa-moe-hara''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Crater (AK-70)|USS ''Crater'' (AK-70)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

In [[astronomy]], an '''asterism''' is a pattern of [[star]]s recognized on Earth's night sky. It may form part of an official [[constellation]], or be composed of stars from more than one. Like constellations, asterisms are in most cases composed of stars which, while they are visible in the same general direction, are not physically related, often being at significantly different distances from Earth. The mostly simple shapes and few stars make these patterns easy to identify, and thus particularly useful to those learning to familiarize themselves with the [[night sky]].

== Background ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Even before{{when|date=June 2013}} the dawn of civilization, it became common to clump various stars together in [[connect-the-dots]] [[stick figures|stick-figure]] patterns. The grouping of stars into constellations is essentially arbitrary, and different cultures have had different constellations, although a few of the more obvious ones tend to recur frequently, ''e.g.'', [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and [[Scorpius]]. Historically, without an &quot;official&quot; list, there was really no difference between a constellation and an asterism. Anyone could arrange and name a grouping which might or might not be generally accepted. Still, some of our own constellations go back at least as far as the [[Babylonian star catalogs|Babylonians]]. 

Our current list is based on that of the Greco-Roman astronomer, [[Claudius Ptolemy]] of Alexandria (c 90–c 168). His list of 48 constellations was accepted as ''the'' standard for 1,800 years. As constellations were considered to be composed only of the stars that constituted the figure, it was always possible to use the leftover, non-figure (&quot;amorphic&quot;) stars to create and squeeze in a new grouping among the established constellations. Two astronomers particularly known for attempting to expand Ptolemy's catalog were [[Johann Bayer]] (1572–1625) and [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] (1713–1762). Bayer listed a dozen figures that had been suggested since Ptolemy's day; Lacaille created new groups, mostly for the area near the South Celestial Pole, unobserved by the ancients. Many of their proposed constellations have been accepted, the rest remaining asterisms, mostly obsolete. Clarification was necessary to determine which groupings ''are'' constellations and which stars belonged to them. The situation was finally regularized in 1930 when the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) divided the sky into [[List of constellations|88 official constellations]] with precise boundaries. Any other grouping is an asterism.

*The seasons indicated here are for the Northern Hemisphere. For the Southern Hemisphere, substitute the opposite season.
*The smaller the number of a star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]], the brighter it is. Thus those of the 1st magnitude are brighter than those of the 2nd. Even negative magnitudes are possible, and the few so rated, though still called &quot;first&quot; magnitude, are the very brightest.
*A true [[star cluster]] (see below), whose stars ''are'' gravitationally related, is not an asterism.

== Large seasonal asterisms ==
Component stars of seasonal asterisms are bright and mark out simple geometric shapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;aoorg&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/Observation/Asterisms.asp AstronomyOnline.org — the Night Sky: Asterisms]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Spring. Spring is marked by the '''[[Great Diamond]]''' consisting of [[Arcturus]], [[Spica]], [[Denebola]], and [[Cor Caroli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aoo4&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/ViewImage.asp?Cate=Home&amp;SubCate=MP01&amp;SubCate2=&amp;Img=/Observation/Images/Asterisms/Asterisms4.jpg&amp;Cpt=Big+Dipper,+Diamond+of+Virgo,+The+Sail,+Sickle,+and+Asses+and+the+Manger AstronomyOnline: Image of ''Big Dipper'', ''Diamond of Virgo'', ''The Sail'', ''Sickle'', and ''Asses'' and the ''Manger'']&lt;/ref&gt; An East-West line from Arcturus to Denebola forms an equilateral triangle with Cor Caroli to the North, and another with Spica to the South. The Arcturus, Regulus, Spica triangle is given the name '''[[Spring Triangle]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/3909-spring-triangle.html Spring triangle ] at Space.com . Accessed March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Together these two triangles form the Diamond. Formally, the stars of the Diamond are located in the constellations [[Boötes]], [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], and [[Canes Venatici]].

*Summer. The '''[[Summer Triangle]]''' of [[Deneb]], [[Altair]], and [[Vega]] — α [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygni]], α [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]e, and α [[Lyra]]e — is easily recognized, as its three stars are all of the 1st magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;wro&quot;&gt;[http://www.wro.org/ras/asterism.htm Warren Rupp Observatory: Table of Asterisms]&lt;/ref&gt; The stars of the Triangle are located in the band of the [[Milky Way]] which marks the galactic equator, and are in the direction of the galactic center.

*Autumn. The '''Great Square of [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]''' is the quadrilateral formed by the stars [[Alpha Pegasi|α Pegasi]], [[Beta Pegasi|β Pegasi]], [[Gamma Pegasi|γ Pegasi]], and [[Alpha Andromedae|α Andromedae]], representing the body of the winged horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;aoo2&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/ViewImage.asp?Cate=Home&amp;SubCate=MP01&amp;SubCate2=&amp;Img=/Observation/Images/Asterisms/Asterisms4.jpg&amp;Cpt=Big+Dipper,+Diamond+of+Virgo,+The+Sail,+Sickle,+and+Asses+and+the+Manger AstronomyOnline: Image of ''Cassiopeia'', ''Square of Pegasus'', ''The Circlet'', and ''Y of Aquarius'']&lt;/ref&gt; It may be glimpsed in its entirety on autumn nights. The asterism was recognized as the constellation '''ASH.IKU''' &quot;The Field&quot; on the [[MUL.APIN]] [[cuneiform]] tablets from about 1100 to 700 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers98_p19&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions], by J.H. Rogers 1998, [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1998JBAA..108....9R/0000019.000.html page 19]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Winter. The winter midnight sky of the northern hemisphere is dominated by [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], in the direction opposite the galactic center. Also, one-third of the 1st-magnitude stars visible in the sky (seven of twenty-one) are in the '''[[Winter Hexagon]]''' with [[Sirius]], [[Procyon]], [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], with 2nd-magnitude [[Castor (star)|Castor]] - [[Capella (star)|Capella]], [[Aldebaran]], and [[Rigel]] on the periphery, and [[Betelgeuse]] located off-center.&lt;ref name=&quot;wro&quot;/&gt; Although somewhat flattened, and thus more elliptical than circular, the figure is so large that it cannot be taken in all at once, thus making the lack of true circularity less noticeable. (The projection in the chart exaggerates the stretching.)  Some prefer to regard it as a '''Heavenly 'G''''.&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;&gt;[http://seds.org/maps/const/asterism.html Asterisms] at [http://seds.org/ SEDS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Procyon, Betelgeuse and Sirius triangle is given the name '''[[Winter Triangle]]'''.

== Other examples ==
[[File:Plough big dipper.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Big Dipper]] asterism]]

One of the best-known asterisms is the '''[[Big Dipper]]''' or '''Plough'''. It is composed of the seven brightest stars in [[Ursa Major]],&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;/&gt; where they delineate the Bear's hindquarters and exaggerated tail. With its longer tail, [[Ursa Minor]] hardly appears bearlike at all, and is widely known by its pseudonym, the '''Little Dipper'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aoo5&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/ViewImage.asp?Cate=Home&amp;SubCate=MP01&amp;SubCate2=&amp;Img=/Observation/Images/Asterisms/Asterisms5.jpg&amp;Cpt=Little+Dipper,+Keystone,+Kite,+and+the+Lozenge Little Dipper, Keystone, Kite, and the Lozenge] in [http://astronomyonline.org/Observation/Asterisms.asp AstronomyOnline.org: Asterisms]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constellation aliases ===
Ursa Minor is not the only constellation that does not look very much like what it represents. Very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. A glance at the stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.
* The best-known of this type is the '''Northern Cross''' in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wro&quot;/&gt; The upright runs from [[Deneb]] (α Cyg) in the Swan's tail to [[Albireo]] (β Cyg) in the beak. The transverse runs from [[Gienah]] (ε Cyg) in one wing to [[Delta Cygni]] (δ Cyg) in the other.
* The '''Fish Hook''' is the traditional Hawaiian name for [[Scorpius]]. The image will be even more obvious if the chart's lines from [[Antares]] (α Sco) to [[Beta Scorpii|Graffias]] (β Sco) and [[Pi Scorpii]] (π Sco) are replaced with a line from Graffias through [[Delta Scorpii|Dschubba]] (δ Sco) to Pi forming a large capped &quot;J.&quot;
* Adding vertical lines to connect the limbs at the left and right in the main diagram of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]] will complete the figure of the '''Butterfly'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/night_sky_040716.html Space.com: ''Hercules: See the Celestial Strongman'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although hardly an ancient notion, it is easy to see why the '''Ice Cream Cone''' is sometimes applied to [[Boötes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsci.cas.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=3&amp;exbid=20&amp;exbpg=13 History of the Constellations: ''Bootes'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is even better known as the '''Kite'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aoo5&quot;/&gt;
* The stars of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] form a '''W''' which is often used as a nickname.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaorg_fall&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/ViewImage.asp?Cate=Home&amp;SubCate=MP01&amp;SubCate2=&amp;Img=/Observation/Images/Asterisms/Asterisms2.jpg&amp;Cpt=The+W,+Square+of+Pegasus,+Circlet,+and+Y+of+Aquarius The W, Square of Pegasus, Circlet, and Y of Aquarius] in [http://astronomyonline.org/Observation/Asterisms.asp AstronomyOnline.org: Asterisms]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Australia, &quot;[[frying pan|Frying Pan]]&quot; for [[Chamaeleon]], is an aid to finding south by the stars.

===Sectional asterisms ===
An asterism may also be a ''section'' of a constellation that refers to the traditional figuring of the whole. Thus, for example, there are: 
*'''[[Orion's Belt|Orion's Belt/The Belt Of Orion]]'''
*The '''Y in [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]''' (historically called &quot;the Urn&quot;)
*'''[[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules's Club]]'''{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
There are many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;/&gt;

=== Non-sectional asterisms ===
Other asterisms are also composed of stars from one constellation, but do not refer to the traditional figures.  
*The four central stars in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], Epsilon (ε Her), [[Zeta Herculis|Zeta]] (ζ Her), Eta (η Her), and [[Pi Herculis|Pi]] (π Her), form the well-known '''Keystone'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wro&quot;/&gt;
*The curve of stars at the front end of the Lion from [[Epsilon Leonis|Al Ashfar]] (ε Leo/Epsilon Leonis) to [[Alpha Leonis|Regulus]] (α Leo/Alpha Leonis), looking much like a mirror-image question mark, has long been known as the '''[[Leo (constellation)|Sickle]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;/&gt;
*The bow and arrow of the Archer also make a well-formed '''[[Sagittarius (constellation)|Teapot]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aoo1&quot;&gt;[http://astronomyonline.org/ViewImage.asp?Cate=Home&amp;SubCate=MP01&amp;SubCate2=&amp;Img=/Observation/Images/Asterisms/Asterisms1.jpg&amp;Cpt=Teapot,+Fish+Hook,+and+Bull+of+Poniatowski Teapot, Fish Hook, and Bull of Poniatowski] in [http://astronomyonline.org/Observation/Asterisms.asp AstronomyOnline.org: Asterisms]&lt;/ref&gt; (There is even a bit of nebulosity near the &quot;spout&quot; to serve as steam).

*[[Alpha Delphini|Alpha]], [[Beta Delphini|Beta]], [[Gamma Delphini|Gamma]], and [[Delta Delphini|Delta]] [[Delphinus|Delphini]] form '''Job's Coffin'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;/&gt;
*The '''[[Terebellum (astronomy)|Terebellum]]''' is a small quadrilateral of four faint stars ([[Omega Sagittarii|Omega]], [[59 Sagittarii|59]], [[60 Sagittarii|60]], [[62 Sagittarii|62]]) in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]' hindquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;allensgr&quot;&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Sagittarius*.html Sagittarius] in [[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Four other stars (Beta — [[Beta Carinae|Miaplacidus]], [[Upsilon Carinae|Upsilon]], [[Theta Carinae|Theta]], and [[Omega Carinae|Omega]] [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]]e) form a well-shaped diamond — the [[Diamond Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cross3&quot;&gt;[http://www.southernskyphoto.com/southern_sky/crosses.htm Starry Night Skies Photography: &quot;Southern Cross, False Cross &amp; Diamond Cross&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Saucepan''' or '''Pot''' can be:-
** The same stars as the Belt and Sword of Orion. The end of the handle is at ι Ori, with the far rim at η Ori.
** In Australia, part of [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]].
*Just south of Pegasus, the western fish of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] is home to the '''Circlet''' formed from [[Gamma Piscium|Gamma]], [[Kappa Piscium|Kappa]], [[Lambda Piscium|Lambda]], [[TX Piscium|TX]], [[Iota Piscium|Iota]], and [[Theta Piscium|Theta]] Piscium.&lt;ref name=&quot;wro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seds&quot;/&gt;
*[[Dubhe]] and [[Beta Ursae Majoris|Merak]] (Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris), the two stars at the end of the bowl of the '''[[Big Dipper]]''' are habitually called '''The Pointers''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/U/UMa.html DavidDarling.info: ''UMa'']&lt;/ref&gt; a line from β to α and continued for a bit over five times the distance between them, arrives at the North Celestial Pole and the star [[Polaris]] (α UMi/Alpha Ursae Minoris), the North Star.
*[[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]] are the '''Southern Pointers''' leading to the Southern Cross&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/Cen.html DavidDarling.info: ''Cen'']&lt;/ref&gt; and thus helping to distinguish [[Crux]] from the [[False Cross]].

=== Cross-border groups ===
Like the seasonal asterisms, there are others that are formed from stars in more than one constellation.
*There is another large asterism which, like the Diamond of Virgo, is composed of a pair of equilateral triangles. [[Sirius]] (α CMa), [[Procyon]] (α CMi), and [[Betelgeuse]] (α Ori) form one to the North ([[Winter Hexagon|Winter Triangle]]) while Sirius, [[Zeta Puppis|Naos]] (ζ Pup), and [[Phakt]] (α Col) form another to the South. Unlike the Diamond, however, these triangles meet, not base-to-base, but vertex-to-vertex, forming the '''Egyptian X'''. The name derives from both the shape and, because the stars straddle the Celestial Equator, it is more easily seen from south of the Mediterranean than in Europe.
*The '''Lozenge''' is a small diamond formed from three stars - [[Eltanin]], [[Grumium]], and [[Rastaban]] (Gamma, Xi, and Beta Draconis) - in the head of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] and one - Iota Herculis - in the foot of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].
*The '''[[False Cross]]''' is composed of the four stars [[Delta Velorum|Delta]] and [[Kappa Velorum]] (δ and κ Vel) and [[Epsilon Carinae|Epsilon]] and [[Iota Carinae]] (ε and ι Car).&lt;ref name=&quot;cross3&quot;/&gt; Although its component stars are not quite as bright as those of the [[Crux|Southern Cross]], it is somewhat larger and better shaped than the Southern Cross, for which it was often mistaken by ships' navigators.
* From latitudes above [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] especially, a prominent upper-case '''Y''' is formed by [[Arcturus]], [[Gamma Bootis|Gamma]] and [[Epsilon Bootis|Epsilon]] Bootis, and [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]] (Alphecca or Gemma). Alpha Coronae Borealis is far brighter than either Delta or Beta Bootis, distorting the &quot;kite&quot; or &quot;ice-cream cone&quot; shape of Bootes. From the [[United Kingdom]] in particular, where there is serious [[light pollution]] in many areas and also [[twilight]] all night for much of the time these constellations appear, this &quot;Y&quot; is often visible while β and δ Bootis and the other stars in Corona Borealis are not.

=== Telescopic patterns ===
Asterisms range from the large and obvious to the small, and even telescopic. 
* A renowned object, the '''[[Brocchi's Cluster|Coathanger]]''', formally [[open cluster]] ''Collinder 399'', in [[Vulpecula]] may be recognized by the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;dratledge&quot;&gt;[http://www.deep-sky.co.uk/asterisms.htm David Ratlegde's Virtual Home: ''Observing Asterisms'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Kemble's Cascade]]''' in [[Camelopardalis]] is a chain of stars (the waterfall) that ends in open cluster NGC 1502.&lt;ref name=&quot;dratledge&quot;/&gt;
* Approximately 40 stars in [[Monoceros]], including a portion of [[NGC 2264]], fill out the triangular '''[[NGC 2264|Christmas Tree Cluster]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backyard-astro.com/focusonarchive/monoceros/monoceros.html A star hop through Monoceros]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former asterisms==

'''Argo''' is a special case. [[Argo Navis]], (&quot;the ship ''Argo''&quot;), was, by far, the largest of Ptolemy's constellations. Starting with Lacaille in his ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum'' (1763), it became common to refer to its various parts as the Keel, the Poop Deck, and the Sails. In the 1930 IAU arrangement, Argo was deemed ''too'' large, and these old sectional asterisms were recognized as official constellations ([[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Puppis]], and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]), thereby turning Argo, ''as a whole'', into an asterism.

The '''Southern Cross''' is not an asterism, but merely a variation on the meaning of [[Crux]]. Crux ''was'' an asterism when Bayer created it in ''[[Uranometria]]'' (1603) from stars in the hind legs of [[Centaurus]]. It was given constellation status in 1930, thereby mutilating the Centaur.

Centaurus had been reduced in size once before. '''[[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]]''' was originally considered to be merely a sectional asterism (as an unspecified Wild Beast in the Centaur's grasp). [[Hipparchus]] split it off in the 200s BC, and Ptolemy's list confirmed its independent status.

In its original figuration, [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] included a spray of faint stars pictured as the tuft in the Lion's Tail which stretched straight out from its body.  Antedating even Ptolemy by centuries, Conon of Alexandria created the asterism &quot;Berenice's Hair&quot; commemorating his queen in 243 BC. Following [[Tycho Brahe|Tycho]]'s acceptance of '''[[Coma Berenices|Coma]]''', Bayer recorded it and refigured the Lion. The IAU confirmed Coma's status as a constellation.

Even so venerable a constellation as '''[[Libra (constellation)|Libra]]''' was once merely an asterism. Until the middle of the first millennium BC, the [[Zodiac]] consisted of only eleven constellations. The [[Bible|biblical]] reference to &quot;the eleven stars&quot; (Genesis 37:9) is more accurately &quot;the eleven asterisms/constellations (of the Zodiac).&quot; At the time, [[Scorpius]]' claws were pictured as extending to [[Zubenelgenubi]], &quot;the southern claw&quot; and [[Zubeneschamali]], &quot;the northern claw&quot; (Alpha and Beta Librae). Later, when [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] was reimagined as Astraea, the goddess of justice, the Claws became a set of scales held in her hand. By Ptolemy's day, Libra had become an independent constellation, unconnected with either of its neighbors. Still, the names of its stars reflect the time when it was the asterism of &quot;The Claws&quot; and its figuration is that of the old sectional asterism within Virgo.

The groups named here were sectional asterisms that have been promoted to constellation status. For a list of proposed constellations that were not accepted as anything beyond asterisms, and are now considered obsolete, see [[Former constellations]].

== Non-asterisms ==

In the formal sense used here, asterisms are groups of stars that have not been categorized as something else.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;While in common parlance, ''any'' fixed celestial feature may be called an asterism, it is not strictly proper to refer to a constellation, cluster, or galaxy as such, and thus reduce it to a mere asterism. The &quot;aliases&quot; are asterisms because they are simplified figures, leaving out the dimmer stars in the official constellations.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects which do not fall within the bounds of this definition include the Milky Way, nebulae, and open clusters.

Dividing the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres, the '''[[Milky Way]]''' appears as a hazy band of white light arching across the entire celestial sphere. Many cultures have [[Milky Way (mythology)|myths]] about &quot;the broad white road in heaven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/hiawatha.html ''The Song of Hiawatha'', Part III: &quot;Hiawatha's Childhood&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; That the glow originates from innumerable faint stars and other materials which lie within the galactic plane was one of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] early telescopic discoveries. Similarly, the '''[[Magellanic Clouds]]''' are not asterisms, but galaxies in their own right.

[[Nebulae]], clouds of gas and dust that dot the galaxy, whether [[emission nebula|emission]], such as the [[Pelican Nebula|Pelican]], or [[dark nebula|dark]], such as the [[Horsehead Nebula|Horsehead]], are clearly not asterisms as they are not composed of stars. 

[[Open clusters]] are groups of stars that are physically related &amp;mdash; gravitationally bound together and moving through the galaxy in the same direction and speed. As these groupings are not human constructs, but real phenomena, they do not count as asterisms. Among the best-known and closest are the [[Pleiades]] ([[Messier object|M45]]) and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[Beehive cluster|Beehive]] ([[Messier object|M44]]) in [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]]. (It may be noted that, ''with the addition of [[Aldebaran]],'' which is in the same line of sight, the Hyades open cluster forms a V-shaped sectional asterism in Taurus).

The fine point of what constitutes an asterism may be seen in two examples. [[Theta Orionis]] (θ Ori) is embedded in, and illuminates, the [[Orion Nebula]] (M42). Looked at telescopically, it resolved into ''four'' stars arranged in a trapezoid, and they were nicknamed the '''[[Trapezium (astronomy)|Trapezium]]'''. The asterism retained this name even when it was discovered that there were yet more stars in the group. However, it has since been determined that the Orion Nebula is a [[stellar nursery]] and that the Trapezium is actually an Open Cluster. Thus it is no longer an asterism. On the other hand, '''[[Messier 73|M73]]''' in [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], which was thought to be an Open Cluster, turns out to be composed of unrelated stars, and may now be considered to be an asterism.

'''Aries''' is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] to the west and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the east. The name Aries is [[Latin]] for [[sheep|ram]], and its symbol is [[File:Aries.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♈}}), representing a ram's horns.  It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1.1% of the [[celestial sphere]]). 

Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the [[Golden Fleece]] of [[Ancient Greek mythology]], it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: [[Hamal]] (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), [[Sheratan]] (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), [[Mesarthim]] (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and [[41 Arietis]] (also fourth magnitude). The few [[deep-sky object]]s within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several [[meteor shower]]s appear to radiate from Aries, including the [[Daytime Arietids]] and the [[Epsilon Arietids]].

== History and mythology ==

Aries is now recognized as an official constellation, albeit as a specific region of the sky, by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. It was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern as well as the surrounding stars.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=128–189}} In the description of the [[Babylonian zodiac]] given in the clay tablets known as the [[MUL.APIN]], the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the [[ecliptic]]. The MUL.APIN was a comprehensive table of the risings and settings of stars, which likely served as an agricultural calendar. Modern-day Aries was known as {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;LÚ.ḪUN.GÁ}}, &quot;The Agrarian Worker&quot; or &quot;The Hired Man&quot;.{{sfn|Evans|1998|p=6}} Although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century BCE, the MUL.APIN reflects a tradition which marks the [[Pleiades]] as the [[vernal equinox]], which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. The earliest identifiable reference to Aries as a distinct constellation comes from the [[boundary stone]]s that date from 1350 to 1000 BCE. On several boundary stones, a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters present. The shift in identification from the constellation as the Agrarian Worker to the Ram likely occurred in later Babylonian tradition because of its growing association with [[Dumuzi the Shepherd]]. By the time the MUL.APIN was created—by 1000 BCE—modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi's ram and a hired laborer. The exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of Aries or other ram figures.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mesopotamian Traditions''|1998}}

In [[ancient Egyptian astronomy]], Aries was associated with the god [[Amon-Ra]], who was depicted as a man with a ram's head and represented fertility and creativity. Because it was the location of the vernal equinox, it was called the &quot;Indicator of the Reborn Sun&quot;.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}} During the times of the year when Aries was prominent, priests would process statues of Amon-Ra to temples, a practice that was modified by [[Persian astronomy|Persian astronomers]] centuries later. Aries acquired the title of &quot;Lord of the Head&quot; in Egypt, referring to its symbolic and mythological importance.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|p=56}}

[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Aries and Musca Borealis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Aries and [[Musca Borealis]] as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]

Aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mediterranean Traditions''|1998}} In [[Hellenistic astrology]], the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of [[Greek mythology]] that rescued [[Phrixos]] and [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]] on orders from [[Hermes]], taking him to the land of [[Colchis]].{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}} Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King [[Athamas]] and his first wife [[Nephele]]. The king's second wife, [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], was jealous and wished to kill his children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in [[Boeotia]], then falsified a message from the [[Oracle of Delphi]] that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop [[Mount Laphystium]] when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}} Helle fell off of Aries's back in flight and drowned in the [[Dardanelles]], also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to [[Zeus]] and gave the Fleece to [[Aeëtes]] of [[Colchis]], who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter [[Chalciope]]. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the [[Golden Fleece]] and was guarded by a dragon.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=90–91}}{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=84–85}} In a later myth, this Golden Fleece was stolen by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}}

Historically, Aries has been depicted as a crouched, wingless ram with its head turned towards Taurus. [[Ptolemy]] asserted in his ''[[Almagest]]'' that [[Hipparchus]] depicted [[Alpha Arietis]] as the ram's muzzle, though Ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure. Instead, it was listed as an &quot;unformed star&quot;, and denoted as &quot;the star over the head&quot;. [[John Flamsteed]], in his ''[[Atlas Coelestis]]'', followed Ptolemy's description by mapping it above the figure's head.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Evans|1998|pp=41–42}} Flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting Aries lying down.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}} Astrologically, Aries has been associated with the head and its [[humorism|humors]].{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|p=5}} It was strongly associated with [[Mars]], both the planet and the god. It was considered to govern Western Europe and Syria, and to indicate a strong temper in a person.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=57–58}}

The [[First Point of Aries]], the location of the [[vernal equinox]], is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the [[celestial equator]] from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BCE. as a point south of [[Gamma Arietis]]. Because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the First Point of Aries has since moved into [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and will move into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] by around 2600 CE. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}}

[[Islamic astronomy|Medieval Muslim astronomers]] depicted Aries in various ways. Astronomers like [[al-Sufi]] saw the constellation as a ram, modeled on the precedent of Ptolemy. However, some Islamic celestial globes depicted Aries as a nondescript four-legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns.{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1985|p=80}} Some early [[Bedouin]] observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky; this constellation featured the [[Pleiades]] as the ram's tail.{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1985|p=123}} The generally accepted Arabic formation of Aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five &quot;unformed&quot; stars, four of which were over the animal's hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over Aries's head.{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1985|pp=162–164}} Al-Sufi's depiction differed from both other Arab astronomers' and Flamsteed's, in that his Aries was running and looking behind itself.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}}

The [[obsolete constellations]] introduced in Aries ([[Musca Borealis]], [[Lilium (constellation)|Lilium]], [[Vespa (constellation)|Vespa]], and [[Apes (constellation)|Apes]]) have all been composed of the northern stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=248}} Musca Borealis was created from the stars [[33 Arietis]], [[35 Arietis]], [[39 Arietis]], and [[41 Arietis]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Musca Borealis}} In 1612, [[Petrus Plancius]] introduced Apes, a constellation representing a bee. In 1624, the same stars were used by [[Jakob Bartsch]] to create a constellation called Vespa, representing a wasp. In 1679 [[Augustin Royer]] used these stars for his constellation Lilium, representing the [[fleur-de-lis]]. None of these constellation became widely accepted. [[Johann Hevelius]] renamed the constellation &quot;Musca&quot; in 1690 in his ''[[Firmamentum Sobiescianum]]''. To differentiate it from [[Musca]], the southern fly, it was later renamed Musca Borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into Aries.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Musca Borealis}}

In 1922, the International Astronomical Union defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, &quot;Ari&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official boundaries of Aries were defined in 1930 by [[Eugène Delporte]] as a polygon of 12 segments. Its [[right ascension]] is between 1&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 46.4&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 29.4&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[declination]] is between 10.36° and 31.22° in the [[equatorial coordinate system]].{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Aries}}

=== In non-Western astronomy ===

In traditional [[Chinese astronomy]], stars from Aries were used in several constellations. The brightest stars—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis—formed a constellation called ''Lou'', variously translated as &quot;bond&quot;, &quot;lasso&quot;, and &quot;sickle&quot;, which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle. This name was shared by the [[Twenty-eight mansions|16th lunar mansion]], the location of the full moon closest to the [[autumnal equinox]]. The lunar mansion represented the area where animals were gathered before sacrifice around that time.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}} This constellation has also been associated with harvest-time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}} [[35 Arietis|35]], [[39 Arietis|39]], and [[41 Arietis]] were part of a constellation called ''Wei'', which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the 17th lunar mansion, which represented [[granary|granaries]]. [[Delta Arietis|Delta]] and [[Zeta Arietis]] were a part of the constellation ''Tianyin'', thought to represent the Emperor's hunting partner. ''Zuogeng'' (''Tso-kang''), a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector, was composed of [[Mu Arietis|Mu]], [[Nu Arietis|Nu]], [[Omicron Arietis|Omicron]], [[Pi Arietis|Pi]], and [[Sigma Arietis]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}}{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}} He was accompanied by ''Yeou-kang'', a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}}

In a similar system to the Chinese, the first lunar mansion in [[Hindu astronomy]] was called &quot;Aswini&quot;, after the traditional names for Beta and Gamma Arietis, the [[Ashvins|Aswins]]. Because the Hindu new year began with the vernal equinox, the [[Rig Veda]] contains over 50 new-year's related hymns to the twins, making them some of the most prominent characters in the work. Aries itself was known as &quot;''Aja''&quot; and &quot;''Mesha''&quot;.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=57–58}} In [[Hebrew astronomy]] Aries was named &quot;''Teli''&quot;; it signified either [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] or [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and generally symbolizes the &quot;Lamb of the World&quot;. The neighboring [[Syria]]ns named the constellation &quot;Amru&quot;, and the bordering Turks named it &quot;Kuzi&quot;.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=57–58}} Half a world away, in the [[Marshall Islands]], several stars from Aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a [[porpoise]], along with stars from [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], and [[Triangulum]]. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis formed the head of the porpoise, while stars from Andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of Cassiopeia formed the tail.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=17–18}} Other [[Polynesian people]]s recognized Aries as a constellation. The [[Marquesas]] islanders called it ''Na-pai-ka''; the [[Maori people|Maori]] constellation ''Pipiri'' may correspond to modern Aries as well.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=279}} In indigenous Peruvian astronomy, a constellation with most of the same stars as Aries existed. It was called the &quot;Market Moon&quot; and the &quot;Kneeling Terrace&quot;, as a reminder for when to hold the annual harvest festival, [[Ayri Huay]].{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=57–58}}

{{further|List of stars in Aries}}

Aries has three prominent stars forming an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis by [[Johann Bayer]]. All three are commonly used for navigation.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Popular Names of Stars''}} There is also one other star above the fourth magnitude, 41 Arietis.  [[Alpha Arietis|α Arietis]], called Hamal, is the brightest [[star]] in Aries. Its traditional name is derived from the Arabic word for &quot;lamb&quot; or &quot;head of the ram&quot; (''ras al-hamal''), which references Aries's mythological background.{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}} With a [[spectral class]] of K2{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}} and a [[luminosity class]] of III, it is an [[orange giant]] with an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 2.00, which lies 66 [[light-year]]s from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Arietis}} Hamal has a [[luminosity]] of 96 [[solar luminosity|L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] and its [[absolute magnitude]] is −0.1.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}

[[Beta Arietis|β Arietis]], also known as Sheratan, is a blue-white star with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.64. Its traditional name is derived from &quot;''sharatayn''&quot;, the Arabic word for &quot;the two signs&quot;, referring to both Beta and Gamma Arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox. The two stars were known to the [[Bedouin]] as &quot;''qarna al-hamal''&quot;, &quot;horns of the ram&quot;.{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1985|p=121}} It is 59 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Arietis}} It has a luminosity of 11 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and its absolute magnitude is 2.1.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} It is a [[spectroscopic binary]] star, one in which the companion star is only known through [[spectroscopy|analysis of the spectra]].{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}} The spectral class of the primary is A5.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}} [[Hermann Carl Vogel]] determined that Sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in 1903; its orbit was determined by [[Hans Ludendorff]] in 1907. It has since been studied for its eccentric orbit.{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}}

[[Gamma Arietis|γ Arietis]], with a common name of Mesarthim, is a [[binary star]] with two white-hued components, located in a rich field of magnitude 8–12 stars. Its traditional name has conflicting derivations. It may be derived from a corruption of &quot;al-sharatan&quot;, the Arabic word meaning &quot;pair&quot; or a word for &quot;fat ram&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}}{{sfn|Davis|1944}} However, it may also come from the Sanskrit for &quot;first star of Aries&quot; or the Hebrew for &quot;ministerial servants&quot;, both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names.{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}} Along with Beta Arietis, it was known to the Bedouin as &quot;''qarna al-hamal''&quot;.{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1985|p=121}} The primary is of magnitude 4.59 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.68.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} The system is 164 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Gamma Arietis}} The two components are separated by 7.8 [[arcsecond]]s,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=90–91}} and the system as a whole has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.9.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}} The primary has a luminosity of 60 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and the secondary has a luminosity of 56 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;; the primary is an A-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.2 and the secondary is a B9-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.4.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} The angle between the two components is 1°.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=90–91}} Mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1664, one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries. The primary, γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Arietis, is an [[Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable]] star that has a range of 0.02 magnitudes and a period of 2.607 days. It is unusual because of its strong [[silicon]] [[emission lines]].{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}}

The constellation is home to several double stars, including Epsilon, Lambda, and Pi Arietis. [[Epsilon Arietis|ε Arietis]] is a binary star with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.5. The system is 290 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}} Its overall magnitude is 4.63, and the primary has an absolute magnitude of 1.4. Its spectral class is A2. The two components are separated by 1.5 arcseconds.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} [[Lambda Arietis|λ Arietis]] is a wide double star with a white-hued primary and a yellow-hued secondary.

The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 8.5.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}} The primary is 776 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Pi Arietis}} The primary itself is a wide double star with a separation of 25.2 arcseconds; the tertiary has a magnitude of 10.8. The primary and secondary are separated by 3.2 arcseconds.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}

Most of the other stars in Aries visible to the naked eye have magnitudes between 3 and 5. [[Delta Arietis|δ Ari]], called Boteïn, is a star of magnitude 4.35, 170 light-years away. It has an absolute magnitude of −0.1 and a spectral class of K2.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Arietis}} [[Zeta Arietis|ζ Arietis]] is a star of magnitude 4.89, 263 light-years away. Its spectral class is A0 and its absolute magnitude is 0.0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Arietis}} [[14 Arietis]] is a star of magnitude 4.98, 288 light-years away. Its spectral class is F2 and its absolute magnitude is 0.6.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|SIMBAD 14 Arietis}} [[39 Arietis]] is a similar star of magnitude 4.51, 172 light-years away.

Its spectral class is B8 and it has a luminosity of 105 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. Its absolute magnitude is −0.2.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|SIMBAD 41 Arietis}} [[53 Arietis]] is a [[runaway star]] of magnitude 6.09, 815 light-years away.{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}}{{sfn|SIMBAD 53 Arietis}} Its spectral class is B2. It was likely ejected from the [[Orion Nebula]] approximately five million years ago, possibly due to [[supernova]]e.{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}} Finally, [[Teegarden's Star]] is the closest star to Earth in Aries. It is a [[brown dwarf]] of magnitude 15.14 and spectral class M6.5V. With a proper motion of 5.1 arcseconds per year, it is the 24th closest star to Earth overall.{{sfn|RECONS, ''The 100 Nearest Star Systems''}}

Aries has its share of variable stars, including R and U Arietis, Mira-type variable stars, and T Arietis, a semi-regular variable star. [[R Arietis]] is a [[Mira variable]] star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.7 to a maximum of 7.4 with a period of 186.8 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} It is 4,080 light-years away.{{sfn|SIMBAD R Arietis}} [[U Arietis]] is another Mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 15.2 to a maximum of 7.2 with a period of 371.1 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} [[T Arietis]] is a [[semiregular variable star]] that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 11.3 to a maximum of 7.5 with a period of 317 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=337–338}} It is 1,630 light-years away.{{sfn|SIMBAD T Arietis}} One particularly interesting variable in Aries is [[SX Arietis]], a rotating variable star considered to be the prototype of its class, [[helium variable]] stars. SX Arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of Helium I and Silicon III. They are normally main-sequence B0p—B9p stars, and their variations are not usually visible to the naked eye. Therefore, they are observed photometrically, usually having periods that fit in the course of one night. Similar to [[Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable]]s, SX Arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field, which correspond to the periodic rotation; they differ from the Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variables in their higher temperature. There are between 39 and 49 SX Arietis variable stars currently known; ten are noted as being &quot;uncertain&quot; in the [[General Catalog of Variable Stars]].{{sfn|Good|2003|pp=136–137}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

The few [[deep-sky object]]s in Aries are very dim. Nevertheless, several scientifically interesting galaxies lie within its borders; it has [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], and [[interacting galaxies]].

[[File:NGC772 SN2003hl SN2003iq 6223 Dahl.jpg|thumb|right|NGC 772, with a notated [[supernova]].]]

[[NGC 772]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] with an [[integrated magnitude]] of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of [[15 Arietis]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=128–129}} It is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its [[surface brightness]], magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a [[galaxy morphological classification|class SA(s)b galaxy]], which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=90–91}} The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy,{{sfn|Burnham, Jr.|1978|pp=245–252}} is home to many [[star formation|star forming regions]]; this is due to previous [[galaxy merger|gravitational interactions]] with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, [[NGC 770]], that is about 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the [[Arp number|Arp peculiar galaxy catalog]]. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Bratton|2011|pp=63–66}} Another spiral galaxy in Aries is [[NGC 673]], a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly [[barred spiral galaxy]] with loosely wound arms. It has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes. It has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core. 171,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 673 is 235 million light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Bratton|2011|pp=63–66}}

[[NGC 678]] and [[NGC 680]] are a pair of galaxies in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the [[NGC 691]] group of galaxies, both are at a distance of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an [[elliptical galaxy]] with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent [[dust lane]]. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away.{{sfn|Bratton|2011|pp=63–66}} [[NGC 877]] is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust.{{sfn|Bratton|2011|pp=63–66}} [[Arp 276]] is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.{{sfn|SIMBAD Arp 276}}

NGC 821 is an E6 elliptical galaxy. It is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away.{{sfn|Bratton|2011|pp=63–66}} Another unusual galaxy in Aries is [[Segue 2 (dwarf galaxy)|Segue 2]]. Segue 2 is a [[dwarf galaxy]] that is a [[List of Milky Way's satellite galaxies|satellite galaxy of the Milky Way]], recently discovered to be a potential relic of the [[epoch of reionization]].{{sfn|Belokurov et al.|2009}}

=== Meteor showers ===

Aries is home to several [[meteor shower]]s. The [[Daytime Arietids|Daytime Arietid]] meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day, lasting from 22 May to 2 June. It is an annual shower associated with the Marsden group of [[comet]]s that peaks on 7 June with a maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] of 54 meteors.{{sfn|Jopek, &quot;Daytime Arietids&quot;}}{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=60}} Its parent body may be the asteroid [[1566 Icarus|Icarus]]. The meteors are sometimes visible before dawn, because the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is 32 degrees away from the Sun. They usually appear at a rate of 1–2 per hour as &quot;earthgrazers&quot;, meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon. Because most of the Daytime Arietids are not visible to the naked eye, they are observed in the [[radio spectrum]]. This is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake.{{sfn|NASA, &quot;June's Invisible Meteors&quot;}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=427–428}} Other meteor showers radiate from Aries during the day; these include the Daytime Epsilon Arietids and the Northern and Southern Daytime May Arietids.{{sfn|Jopek, &quot;Meteor List&quot;}} The [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] discovered the Daytime Arietids in 1947 when James Hey and G.S. Stewart adapted the [[Battle of Britain#Control systems|World War II-era radar systems]] for meteor observations.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=427–428}}

The [[Delta Arietids]] are another meteor shower radiating from Aries. Peaking on 9 December with a low peak rate, the shower lasts from 8 December to 14 January, with the highest rates visible from 8 to 14 December. The average Delta Aquarid meteor is very slow, with an average velocity of {{convert|13.2|km|mi}} per second. However, this shower sometimes produces bright [[meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s.{{sfn|Levy|2007|p=122}} This meteor shower has northern and southern components, both of which are likely associated with [[1990 HA]], a [[near-Earth asteroid]].{{sfn|Langbroek|2003}}

The [[Autumn Arietids]] also radiate from Aries. The shower lasts from 7 September to 27 October and peaks on 9 October. Its peak rate is low.{{sfn|Levy|2007|p=119}} The [[Epsilon Arietids]] appear from 12 to 23 October.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=36–41}} Other meteor showers radiating from Aries include the October Delta Arietids, [[Daytime Epsilon Arietids]], [[Daytime May Arietids]], [[Sigma Arietids]], [[Nu Arietids]], and [[Beta Arietids]].{{sfn|Jopek, &quot;Meteor List&quot;}} The Sigma Arietids, a class IV meteor shower, are visible from 12 to 19 October, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on 19 October.{{sfn|Lunsford, Showers}}

=== Planetary systems ===

Aries contains several stars with [[extrasolar planets]]. [[HIP 14810]], a G5 type star, is orbited by three [[giant planet]]s (those more than ten times the [[mass of Earth]]).{{sfn|Wright et al.|2009}} [[HD 12661]], like HIP 14810, is a G-type main sequence star, slightly larger than the Sun, with two orbiting planets. One planet is 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, and the other is 1.57 times the mass of Jupiter.{{sfn|''ExoPlanet'' HD 12661}} [[HD 20367]] is a G0 type star, approximately the size of the Sun, with one orbiting planet. The planet, discovered in 2002, has a mass 1.07 times that of Jupiter and orbits every 500 days.{{sfn|''ExoPlanet'' HD 20367}}

==Astrology==
{{main|Aries (astrology)}}

{{As of|2002}}, the Sun resides in the constellation Aries from April 18 to May 13 as it moves through the ecliptic. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] from March 21 to April 20, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from April 15 to May 15.

'''Taurus''' is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], which means it is crossed by the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Its name is a [[Latin]] word meaning &quot;[[Cattle|bull]]&quot;, and its [[astrology|astrological]] symbol is a stylized bull's head: [[File:Taurus.svg|14px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♉}}). Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Taurus came to symbolize the bull in the mythologies of  Ancient [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt]] and [[Greek mythology|Greece]].

There are a number of features of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest [[open cluster]]s to Earth, the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the [[red giant]] [[Aldebaran]] is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the [[supernova remnant]] [[Messier 1]], more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The [[variable star]] [[T Tauri]] is the prototype of a class of [[pre-main-sequence star]]s.

== Characteristics ==

Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky, between [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] to the west and [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the east; to the north lie [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], to the southeast [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], to the south [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], and to the southwest [[Cetus]]. In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfinkle 1997&quot; /&gt;

This constellation forms part of the zodiac, and hence is intersected by the [[ecliptic]]. This circle across the [[celestial sphere]] forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfinkle 1997&quot; /&gt; The [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the [[galactic anticenter]] is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as the [[Gould's Belt]] passes through the Taurus constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossen_rhemann2004&quot; /&gt;

The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is &quot;Tau&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot; /&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|03|23.4}} and {{RA|05|53.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 31.10° and −1.35°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot; /&gt; Because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the [[celestial equator]], this can not be a completely [[circumpolar constellation]] at any latitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds2007&quot; /&gt;

== Notable features ==

[[File:TaurusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Taurus as it can be seen by the naked eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;allthesky&quot; /&gt; The constellation lines have been added for clarity.]]

During November, the [[Taurid]] [[meteor shower]] appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The [[Beta Taurid]] meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis1997&quot; /&gt; In October, between the 18th and the 29th, both the [[Northern Taurids]] and the [[Southern Taurids]] are active; though the latter stream is stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 22 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 23 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brightest member of this constellation is [[Aldebaran]], an orange-hued, [[spectral class]] K5&amp;nbsp;III [[giant star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; Its name derives from '''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:الدبران|الدبران]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabarān}}'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for &quot;the follower&quot;, probably from the fact that it follows the [[Pleiades]] during the nightly motion of the  [[celestial sphere]] across the sky. &lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 188 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;schaff&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=383}} Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a ''V'' or ''A''-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Olcott&quot; /&gt; the nearest distinct open [[star cluster]] after the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inglis2004&quot; /&gt; In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as &quot;glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;saski_boddy2003&quot; /&gt; a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2003|p=55}} It includes a naked eye double star, [[Theta Tauri]], with a separation of 5.6&amp;nbsp;[[arcminutes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kaler_theta_tauri&quot; /&gt;

In the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the [[Pleiades]] (M45), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] six, and so the cluster is also named the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;. However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope.&lt;ref name=&quot;marx_pfau_lamble1992&quot; /&gt; Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; there are also many small [[brown dwarf]]s and [[white dwarf]]s. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot; /&gt; The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=94}}

In the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of [[NGC 1514]]. This [[planetary nebula]] is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that [[nebula]]e were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer [[William Huggins]] used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|pp=74–77}}

To the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by [[Beta Tauri|Beta (β) Tauri]] and [[Zeta Tauri|Zeta (ζ) Tauri]]; two star systems that are separated by 8°. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as ''El Nath'', which comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;the butting&quot;, as in butting by the horns of the bull.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, at p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; At magnitude 1.65, it is the second brightest star in the constellation, and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. As a result, it also bears the designation Gamma Aurigae. Zeta Tauri is an [[eclipsing binary]] star that completes an orbit every 133 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt;

A degree to the northwest of ζ Tauri is the [[Crab Nebula]] ([[Messier object|M1]]), a [[supernova remnant]]. This expanding [[nebula]] was created by a [[Type II supernova]] explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawkins2002&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;covington2002&quot; /&gt; [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American peoples]] also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when [[John Bevis]] found it.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot; /&gt;

The star [[Lambda Tauri|Lambda (λ) Tauri]] is an [[eclipsing binary]] star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of their orbit]] lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 [[astronomical unit]]s, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;apj263_289&quot; /&gt;

Located about 1.8° west of [[Epsilon Tauri|Epsilon (ε) Tauri]] is [[T Tauri]], the prototype of a class of [[variable star]]s called [[T Tauri star]]s. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between [[visual magnitude|magnitude]] 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfinkle 1997&quot; /&gt; This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a [[main sequence]] star.&lt;ref name=&quot;araa27_1_351&quot; /&gt; The surrounding [[reflection nebula]] [[NGC 1555]] is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;noao_1555&quot; /&gt;

This constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star forming region of sparse, filamentary clouds. This spans a diameter of {{Convert|98|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} and contains 35,000&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es of material, which is both larger and less massive than the [[Orion Nebula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schulz2005&quot; /&gt; At a distance of {{Convert|490|ly|pc|abbr=off}}, this is one of the nearest active star forming regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;babu_feigelson1996&quot; /&gt; Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism [[NGC 1746]] spanning a width of 45 [[arcminute]]s.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=84}}

The identification of the [[constellation]] of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the [[Chalcolithic]], and perhaps even to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Michael Rappenglück of the [[University of Munich]] believes that Taurus is represented in a [[cave painting]] at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at [[Lascaux]] (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.&lt;ref name=&quot;arxiv0810.1592&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse20000809&quot; /&gt; The name &quot;seven sisters&quot; has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of Australia, North America and Siberia. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown2008&quot; /&gt;

Taurus marked the point of [[vernal equinox|vernal (spring) equinox]] in the [[Chalcolithic]] and the [[Early Bronze Age]], from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;noonan05&quot; /&gt; The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the [[23rd century BC]]. In [[Babylonian astronomy]], the constellation was listed in the [[MUL.APIN]] as  {{lang|sux-Latn|GU&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.AN.NA}}, &quot;The Heavenly Bull&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers1998&quot; /&gt; As this constellation marked the vernal equinox, it was also the first constellation in the Babylonian zodiac and they described it as &quot;The Bull in Front&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson1997&quot; /&gt; The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] name was ''Alu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;white2008&quot; /&gt;

In the [[Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the [[Ancient literature|earliest works of literature]], the goddess [[Ishtar]] sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.&lt;ref name=&quot;hines2002&quot; /&gt; Gilgamesh is depicted as the neighboring constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and in the sky they face each other as if engaged in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns120_36&quot; /&gt; In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian religion|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for &quot;star-constellation&quot;), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.&lt;ref name=&quot;white2008&quot; /&gt;

The same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the [[Dendera zodiac]], an [[Egypt]]ian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the [[celestial hemisphere]] using a [[planisphere]]. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;jbaa108_1_9&quot; /&gt; To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This &quot;sacrifice&quot; led to the renewal of the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ptak1998&quot; /&gt; To the early [[Hebrews]], Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, [[Aleph]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=381}}

In [[Greek mythology]], Taurus was identified with [[Zeus]], who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife [[Hera]], Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath1989&quot; /&gt; Greek mythographer [[Acusilaus]] marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the [[Cretan Bull]], one of [[Labors of Hercules|The Twelve Labors]] of [[Heracles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;palaephatus_stern1996&quot; /&gt;

Taurus became an important object of worship among the [[Druid]]s. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;noonan05&quot; /&gt; In [[Buddhism]], legends hold that [[Gautama Buddha]] was born when the [[Full Moon]] was in [[Vaisakha]], or Taurus.&lt;ref name=&quot;grundwedel1901&quot; /&gt; Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or [[Vesākha]], which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.&lt;ref name=&quot;mr2007&quot; /&gt;

==Stars==

{{seealso|List of stars in Hercules}}
Hercules has no [[apparent magnitude|first or second magnitude]] stars. However, it does have several stars above magnitude 4. [[Alpha Herculis]], traditionally called Rasalgethi, is a [[binary star]] resolvable in small amateur telescopes, 400 light-years from Earth. The primary is an irregular [[variable star]]; it is a [[red giant]] with a minimum magnitude of 4 and a maximum magnitude of 3. It has a diameter of 400 [[solar diameter]]s. The secondary, which orbits every 3600 years, is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.4. Its common name means &quot;the kneeler's head&quot;. [[Beta Herculis]], also called Kornephoros, is the brightest star in Hercules. It is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 2.8, 148 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;club-bearer&quot;. [[Delta Herculis]] is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.1,and is 78 light-years from Earth. The optical companion is of magnitude 8.2. [[Gamma Herculis]] is also a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a [[white giant]] of magnitude 3.8, 195 light-years from Earth. The optical companion, widely separated, is 10th magnitude. [[Zeta Herculis]] is a binary star that is becoming divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, as the components widen to their peak in 2025. The system, 35 light-years from Earth, has a period of 34.5 years. The primary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 2.9 and the secondary is an orange star of magnitude 5.7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

There are several dimmer [[variable star]]s in Hercules. [[30 Herculis]], also called g Herculis, is a [[semiregular variable|semiregular]] [[red giant]] with a period of 3 months. 361 light-years from Earth, it has a minimum magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum magnitude of 4.3. [[68 Herculis]], also called u Herculis, is a [[Beta Lyrae variable|Beta Lyrae-type]] [[eclipsing binary]] star. 865 light-years from Earth, it has a period of 2 days; its minimum magnitude is 5.4 and its maximum magnitude is 4.7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

Hercules is also home to many double stars and binary stars. [[Kappa Herculis]] is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 388 light-years from Earth; the secondary is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 6.3, 470 light-years from Earth. [[Rho Herculis]] is a binary star 402 light-years  from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. Both components are blue-green giant stars; the primary is magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is magnitude 5.5. [[95 Herculis]] is a binary star divisible in small telescopes, 470 light-years from Earth. The primary is a silvery giant star of magnitude 4.9 and the secondary is an old giant star of magnitude 5.2. [[100 Herculis]] is a double star easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. Both components are magnitude 5.8 blue-white stars; they are 165 and 230 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

[[Mu Herculis]] is 27.4 [[light-year]]s from Earth. The [[solar apex]], i.e., the point on the sky which marks the direction that the Sun is moving in its orbit around the center of the [[Milky Way]], is located within Hercules,&lt;ref name=Struve&gt;{{cite book  | last = Struve  | first = Otto  | authorlink = Otto Struve  | coauthors = Lynds, Beverly and Pillans, Helen  | title = Elementary Astronomy  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | date = 1959  | location = New York  | pages = 150  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; close to [[Vega]] in neighboring [[Lyra]].

==Planetary systems==

Fifteen stars in Hercules are known to be orbited by [[extrasolar planet]]s.

* [[14 Herculis]] has two planets. The planet [[14 Herculis b]] had the longest period (4.9 years) and widest orbit (2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) at the time of discovery. The planet [[14 Herculis c]] orbits much further out with very low eccentricity.
* [[HD 149026]] has a [[transit (astronomy)|transiting]] [[hot Jupiter]] [[HD 149026 b|planet]] and is one of the most prominent and studied.
* [[HD 154345]] has the planet [[HD 154345 b]], a long period (9.095 years) and wide orbit (4.18 AU).
* [[HD 164922]] has the first long period Saturn-like [[HD 164922 b|planet]] discovered. The [[mass]] is 0.36 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and [[semimajor axis]] of 2.11 AU.
* [[HD 147506]] has the most massive transiting planet [[HAT-P-2b]] at the time of discovery. The mass is 8.65 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.
* [[HD 155358]] has two planets around the lowest [[metallicity]] planet-harboring star (21% Sun). Both planets orbit in mild eccentricities.
* [[GSC 03089-00929]] has a short transiting planet [[TrES-3]]. The [[orbital period|period]] was 31 hours and undergoing [[orbital decay]].
* [[Gliese 649]] has a [[Gliese 649 b|saturnian planet]] around the red dwarf star.
* [[HD 156668]] has a 4.15 [[HD 156668 b|Earth mass planet]].

==Deep-sky objects==

Hercules contains two bright [[globular cluster]]s: [[Globular Cluster M13|M13]], the brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere, and [[Globular Cluster M92|M92]]. It also contains the nearly spherical [[planetary nebula]] [[Abell 39]]. M13 lies between the stars [[Eta Herculis|η Her]] and [[Zeta Herculis|ζ Her]]; it is dim, but may be detected by the unaided eye on a very clear night.

M13, visible to both the naked eye and binoculars, is a globular cluster of the 6th magnitude that contains more than 300,000 stars and is 25,200 light-years from Earth. It is also very large, with an apparent diameter of over 0.25 degrees, half the size of the [[full moon]]; its physical diameter is more than 100 light-years. Individual stars in M13 are resolvable in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

[[Messier 92|M92]] is a globular cluster of magnitude 6.4, 26,000 light-years from earth. It is a Shapley class IV cluster, indicating that it is quite concentrated at the center; it has a very clear nucleus.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=150}} M92 is visible as a fuzzy star in binoculars, like M13; it is denser and smaller than the more celebrated cluster. The oldest globular cluster known at 14 billion years, its stars are resolvable in a medium-aperture amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

[[NGC 6229]] is a dimmer globular cluster, with a magnitude of 9.4, it is the third-brightest globular in the constellation. 100,000 light-years from Earth, it is a Shapley class IV cluster, meaning that it is fairly rich in the center and quite concentrated at the nucleus.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=154}}

[[NGC 6210]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of the 9th magnitude, 4000 light-years from Earth visible as a blue-green elliptical disk in amateur telescopes larger than 75 mm in aperture.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

The [[Hercules Cluster]] (Abell 2151) is a cluster of galaxies in Hercules.

The [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], the largest structure in the universe, is in Hercules.

==Visualizations==
===Traditional===
[[Image:Hercules Historical View.png|thumb|right|200px|Traditional view of the Hercules constellation highlighting the [[Quadrilateral|quadrangle]] which forms the Keystone asterism.]]
The traditional visualization imagines [[Alpha Herculis|α Herculis]] as Hercules's head; its name, [[Ras Algethi]], literally means &quot;head of the kneeling one&quot;.  Hercules's left hand then points toward Lyra from his shoulder ([[Delta Herculis|δ Herculis]]), and [[Beta Herculis|β Herculis]], or Kornephoros (&quot;club-bearer&quot;) forms his other shoulder.  His narrow waist is formed by [[Epsilon Herculis|ε Herculis]] and [[Zeta Herculis|ζ Herculis]].  Finally, his left leg (with [[Theta Herculis|θ Herculis]] as the knee and [[Iota Herculis|ι Herculis]] the foot) is stepping on Draco's head, the dragon/snake who Hercules has vanquished and perpetually gloats over for eternities.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 150 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Keystone asterism ===
[[Image:Hercules constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|200px|right|An alternative way to connect the stars of the constellation Hercules, suggested by [[H.A. Rey]]. Here, Hercules is shown with his head at the top.]]
[[Image:Herculesurania.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hercules as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. The figure appears upside down in the sky relative to neighbouring constellations.]]
A common form found in modern star charts uses the quadrangle formed by [[Pi Herculis|π Her]], [[Eta Herculis|η Her]], [[Zeta Herculis|ζ Her]] and [[Epsilon Herculis|ε Her]] (known as the &quot;Keystone&quot; [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]) as Hercules's torso.

===H.A. Rey===
[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative visualization in which the &quot;Keystone&quot; becomes Hercules's head. This quadrangle lies between two very bright stars: [[Vega]] in the constellation Lyra and [[Alpha Coronae Borealis|α CrB]] (Gemma, or Alphecca) in the constellation [[Corona Borealis]]. The hero's right leg contains two bright stars of the third magnitude: [[Alpha Herculis|α Her]] (Ras Algethi) and [[Delta Herculis|δ Her]] (Sarin).  The latter is the right knee. The hero's left leg contains dimmer stars of the fourth magnitude which do not have [[Bayer designation]]s but which do have [[Flamsteed designation|Flamsteed numbers]]. The star [[Beta Herculis|β Her]] belongs to the hero's outstretched right hand, and is also called Kornephoros.

==History==
According to Gavin White, the Greek constellation of Hercules is a distorted version of the Babylonian constellation known as the &quot;Standing Gods&quot; (MUL.DINGIR.GUB.BA.MESH). White argues that this figure was, like the similarly named &quot;Sitting Gods&quot;, depicted as a man with a serpent's body instead of legs (the serpent element now being represented on the Greek star map by the figure of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] that Hercules crushes beneath his feet). He further argues that the original name of Hercules - the 'Kneeler' (see below) - is a conflation of the two Babylonian constellations of the Sitting and Standing Gods.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 199ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Greek references to the constellation do not refer to it as Hercules. [[Aratus]] describes it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Right there in its [Draco's] orbit wheels a Phantom form, like to a man that strives at a task. That sign no man knows how to read clearly, nor what task he is bent, but men simply call him On His Knees '' [{{lang|grc|Ἐγγόνασιν}} &quot;the Kneeler&quot;].&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Ἐγγόνασιν (ἐν γόνασιν),   Arat. 66, 669, Gal. 9. 936, etc.&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29eggo%2Fnasin]
Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott. ''A Greek-English Lexicon''. Oxford. Clarendon Press, 1940.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now that Phantom, that toils on his knees, seems to sit on bended knee, and from both his shoulders his hands are upraised and stretch, one this way, one that, a fathom's length. Over the middle of the head of the crooked Dragon, he has the tip of his right foot. Here too that Crown [Corona], which glorious Dionysus set to be memorial of the dead Ariadne, wheels beneath the back of the toil-spent Phantom. To the Phantom’s back the Crown is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus [...] Yonder, too, is the tiny Tortoise, which, while still beside his cradle, Hermes pierced for stings and bade it be called the Lyre [Lyra]: and he brought it into heaven and set it in front of the unknown Phantom. That Croucher on his Knees comes near the Lyre with his left knee, but the top of the Bird’s head wheels on the other side, and between the Bird’s head and the Phantom’s knee is enstarred the Lyre.''&lt;ref&gt;trans. Mair, A. W. &amp; G. R. Loeb Classical Library Volume 129. London: William Heinemann, 1921.[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AratusPhaenomena.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The story connecting Hercules with the constellation is recounted by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On his way back to [[Mycenae]] from [[Iberia]] having obtained the Cattle of [[Geryon]] as his [[The Twelve Labours|tenth labour]] Heracles came to [[Liguria]] in North-Western [[Italy]] where he engaged in battle with two giants, [[Alebion|Albion]] and [[Bergion]] or Dercynus. The opponents were strong; Hercules was in a difficult position so he prayed to his father [[Zeus]] for help. With the aegis of Zeus, Heracles won the battle. It was this kneeling position of Heracles when prayed to his father Zeus that gave the name &quot;the Kneeler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], i. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hyginus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], Astronomica Part 1, 6. The kneeler: [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html#II.6_THE_KNEELER Poet. Astr. ii. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hercules is also sometimes associated with [[Gilgamesh]], a [[Sumer]]ian mythological hero.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=154-156}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that correspond to Hercules are located in two areas: the [[Purple Forbidden enclosure]] (紫微垣, ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'') and the [[Heavenly Market enclosure]] (天市垣, ''Tiān Shì Yuán'').

'''Corvus''' is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[raven]] or [[crow]]. It includes only 11 stars visible to the [[naked eye]] (brighter than [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] 4.02). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by [[Ptolemy]], who only counted 7 stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{Main|List of stars in Corvus}}
Four principal stars, [[Delta Corvi|δ]], [[Gamma Corvi|γ]], [[Epsilon Corvi|ε]], and [[Beta Corvi|β Crv]], form an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as &quot;the &quot;[[Spica]]'s [[Spanker (sail)|Spanker]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nickel, J., (1999): ''Lift Up Your Eyes on High: Understanding the Stars'', Christian Liberty Press, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;the Sail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bakich, M. E., (1995): ''The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pp. 21,22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullaney, J., (2007): ''The Herschel objects and how to observe them''
 &lt;Astronomers' Observing Guides&gt;, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  γ and δ serve as pointers toward Spica.

The four brightest stars in Corvus are mostly unremarkable. [[Alpha Corvi]], also called Alchiba, is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.0, 40 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Corvi]] is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 2.7, 140 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Corvi]], also called Gienah, is the brightest star in Corvus at magnitude 2.6. 165 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white hued giant star. Its traditional name means &quot;wing&quot;. [[Delta Corvi]], traditionally called Algorab, is a [[double star]] divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.9, 88 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-tinged star of magnitude 9. Its common name means &quot;the raven&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=128-130}}

[[Struve 1669]] is a [[binary star]] that is divisible by small amateur telescopes, 280 light-years from Earth. The pair, both white stars, is visible to the naked eye at magnitude 5.2; the primary is of magnitude 5.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=128-130}}

[[31 Crateris]] (which was originally placed within in [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]]) is a 5.2 magnitude star which was once mistaken for a [[Mercury's moon|moon of Mercury]].

[[TT Corvi]] is a [[Semiregular variable star|Semiregular variable]] [[red giant]] of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant.{{sfn|Tabur|Bedding|2009}}

==Notable deep-sky objects==
Corvus contains no [[Messier object]]s.

The [[Antennae galaxies|Antennae]] [[peculiar galaxy]], NGC 4038 and 4039,  consists of two [[galaxy merger|interacting]] galaxies that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] and are now experiencing extensive [[star formation]] due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple [[ultraluminous X-ray source]]s, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting [[binary star]]s or [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Antennae galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=128-130}}

The center of Corvus is home to a [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 4361]].  The nebula itself resembles a small [[elliptical galaxy]], but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Uraniæ, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb||300px|Corvus, [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]], and other constellations seen around [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
The Greek figure of Corvus is modeled on the Babylonian Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN), which was similarly placed sitting on the tail of the Serpent (Greek [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to [[Adad]], the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the start of the autumnal rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 166ff&lt;/ref&gt;

One myth associated with Corvus is that of [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]] and [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]]. Coronis had been unfaithful to her lover, who learned this information from a pure white crow. Apollo then turned its feathers black in a fit of rage.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=128-130}}

Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, in order to eat [[Common fig|fig]]s. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo saw this to be a lie, however, and flung the crow (Corvus), cup ([[Crater (constellation)|Crater]]), and the snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by making sure that it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is barely out of reach.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=128-130}}

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corvus are located within the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060722.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 22 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indian astronomy]], the first five stars of Corvus correspond to the ''Hastā'', the 11th ''[[nakshatra]]'' or [[lunar mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hinckley Allen|Allen, R. H.]], (1963): ''[[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]]'', [[New York]], Dover Publications, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corvus was recognized as a constellation by several [[Polynesia]]n cultures. In the [[Marquesas Islands]], it was called ''Mee''; in [[Pukapuka]], it was called ''Te Manu'', and in the [[Society Islands]], it was called ''Metua-ai-papa''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}

'''Chamaeleon''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|iː|l|i|ən}}) is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It is named after the [[chameleon]], a kind of [[lizard]]. It was first defined in the 16th century.

==History==
Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}} It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;!-- The preceding is not covered by Staal (1988) --&gt; [[Johann Bayer]] was the first [[uranography|uranographer]] to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas. It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=260}}

==Notable features==
[[Image:Constellation Chamaeleon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The constellation Chamaeleon as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

=== Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Chamaeleon}}

There are four bright stars in Chamaeleon. [[Alpha Chamaeleontis]] is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.1, 63 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Chamaeleontis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Chamaeleontis]] is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 4.1, 413 light-years from Earth. The other bright star in Chamaeleon is [[Delta Chamaeleontis]], a wide [[double star]]. The brighter star is [[Delta2 Chamaeleontis|Delta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Chamaeleontis]], a blue-hued star of magnitude 4.4, 364 light-years from Earth. [[Delta1 Chamaeleontis|Delta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Chamaeleontis]], the dimmer component, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.5, 354 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}}

Chamaeleon is also the location of [[Cha 110913]], a unique dwarf star or proto solar system.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
In 1999, a nearby [[open cluster]] was discovered centered on the star [[Eta Chamaeleontis|η Chamaeleontis]]. The cluster, known as either
the [[Eta Chamaeleontis cluster]] or Mamajek 1, is 8 million years old, and lies 316 [[light years]] from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Luhman, K.L. &amp; Steeghs, D. 2004, ApJ, 609, 917&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation contains a number of [[molecular clouds]] (the [[Chamaeleon complex|Chamaeleon dark clouds]]) that are forming low-mass [[T Tauri star]]s. The cloud complex lies some 400 to 600 [[light years]] from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. The most prominent cluster of T Tauri stars and young B-type stars are in the Chamaeleon I cloud, and are associated with the reflection nebula [[IC 2631]].

Chamaeleon contains one planetary nebula, [[NGC 3195]], which is fairly faint. It appears in a telescope at about the same apparent size as [[Jupiter]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that form Chamaeleon were classified as the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Little Dipper]] (小斗, ''Xiǎodǒu'') among the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060728.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 28 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monoceros''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Μονόκερως) is a faint [[constellation]] on the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is Greek for [[unicorn]]. Its definition is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]]. It is bordered by [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] to the west, [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the north, [[Canis Major]] to the south and [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] to the east. Other bordering constellations include [[Canis Minor]], [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] and [[Puppis]].

== Notable features ==
[[Image:MonocerosCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Monoceros as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
Monoceros is a constellation that is not very easily seen with the naked eye, with only a few fourth magnitude stars. [[Alpha Monocerotis]] has a [[visual magnitude]] of 3.93, slightly brighter than [[Gamma Monocerotis]] at 3.98.

However, Monoceros does have some interesting features to observe with the aid of a small [[telescope]]. [[Beta Monocerotis]] is an impressive [[triple star]] system, the three stars forming a triangle which seems to be fixed. The visual magnitudes of the stars are 4.7, 5.2 and 6.1. [[William Herschel]] discovered it in 1781 and commented that it is &quot;one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens&quot;.

[[Epsilon Monocerotis]] is a fixed [[binary star|binary]], with visual magnitudes of 4.5 and 6.5.

[[S Monocerotis]], or 15 Monocerotis, is a bluish white [[variable star]] and is located at the center of [[NGC 2264]]. The variation in its magnitude is slight (4.2–4.6). It has a companion star of visual magnitude 8.

[[V838 Monocerotis]], a [[variable star|variable]] [[red supergiant]] star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased by a factor of 10,000 in one day. After the outburst was over, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was able to observe a [[light echo]], which illuminated the dust surrounding the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monoceros also contains [[Plaskett's Star]], which is a massive binary system whose combined mass is estimated to be that of almost 100 Suns put together.

===Planets===
Monoceros contains two super-Earth [[exoplanet]]s in one [[planetary system]]: [[COROT-7b]] was detected by the [[COROT]] satellite and [[COROT-7c]] was detected by [[HARPS]] from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of [[Kepler-10b]] in January 2011, COROT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's). Both planets in this system were discovered in 2009.

===Deep-sky objects===
Monoceros contains many clusters and nebulae, most notable among them:
* [[Messier 50|M50]], an [[open cluster]]
* The [[Rosette Nebula]] (NGC 2237, 2238, 2239, and 2246) is a [[diffuse nebula]] in Monoceros. It has an overall magnitude of 6.0 and is 4900 light-years from Earth. The Rosette Nebula, over 100 light-years in diameter, has an associated star cluster and possesses many [[Bok globule]]s in its dark areas. It was independently discovered in the 1880s by [[Lewis Swift]] (early 1880s) and [[Edward Emerson Barnard]] (1883) as they hunted for [[comets]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=104}}
* The [[Christmas Tree Cluster]] (NGC 2264) is another open cluster in Monoceros. Named for its resemblance to a [[Christmas tree]], it is fairly bright at an overall magnitude of 3.9; it is 2400 light-years from Earth. The [[variable star]] [[S Monocerotis]] represents the tree's trunk, while the variable star [[V429 Monocerotis]] represents its top.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=82-83}}
* The [[Cone Nebula]] (NGC 2264), associated with the Christmas Tree Cluster, is a very dim nebula that contains a dark conic structure. It appears clearly in photographs, but is very elusive in a telescope. The nebula contains several [[Herbig-Haro objects]], which are small irregularly variable nebulae. They are associated with [[protostar]]s.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=83}}
* [[NGC 2254]] is an open cluster with an overall magnitude of 9.7, 7100 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class f and Trumpler class I 2 p cluster, meaning that it appears to be a fairly rich cluster overall, though it has fewer than 50 stars. It appears distinct from the background star field and is very concentrated at its center; its stars range moderately in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=85}}
* [[Hubble's Variable Nebula]] (NGC 2261) is a nebula with an approximate magnitude of 10, 2500 light-years from Earth. Though it is named for [[Edwin Hubble]], it was discovered in 1783 by [[William Herschel]]. Hubble's Variable Nebula is illuminated by [[R Monocerotis]], a young variable star embedded in the nebula; the star's unique interaction with the material in the nebula makes it both an [[emission nebula]] and a [[reflection nebula]]. One hypothesis regarding their interaction is that the nebula and its illuminating star are a very early stage [[planetary system]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=105-106}}

[[Image:Constellation Mensa.jpg|thumb|256px|The constellation Mensa as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
'''Mensa''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky, created in the 18th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[Table (furniture)|table]]. It covers a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]-shaped wedge of sky stretching from approximately 4h to 7.5h of right ascension, and &amp;minus;71 to &amp;minus;85.5 degrees of declination. Other than the south polar constellation of [[Octans]], it is the most southerly of constellations. As a result, it is essentially unobservable from the [[Northern hemisphere|Northern Hemisphere]]. Besides those already mentioned, its other neighbouring constellations are [[Chamaeleon]], [[Dorado]], [[Hydrus]], and [[Volans]].{{fact|date=October 2013}} It is the only constellation named after a feature on Earth.

==History==
Mensa was created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] out of dim Southern Hemisphere stars in honor of [[Table Mountain]], a South African mountain. Although the stars of Mensa do not feature in any ancient mythology, the mountain it is named after has a rich mythology. Called &quot;Tafelberg&quot; in Dutch and German, the [[mesa]] has two neighboring mountains called &quot;Devil's Peak&quot; and &quot;Lion's Head&quot;. Table Mountain features in the mythology of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], notorious for its storms&amp;mdash;the explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] saw the mesa as a mythical anvil for storms. Another myth relating to its dangers comes from [[Sinbad the Sailor]], an Arabic folk hero who saw the mountain as a magnet pulling his ships to the bottom of the sea.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=259}}

==Notable features==

===Stars===
Mensa contains no bright stars, with [[Alpha Mensae]] its brightest star at a barely visible magnitude 5.09, making  it the faintest constellation in the entire sky. [[Alpha Mensae]] is a [[Sun|solar-type]] star ([[spectral classification|class]] G5 V) 33 light-years from Earth, and is considered a good prospect for harboring an [[Earth]]-like [[planet]]. [[Pi Mensae]], on the other hand, while also solar-type (G1) and at 59 light-years, has been found to have a large [[gas giant]] in an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] [[orbit]] crossing the [[habitable zone]], which would effectively rule out the existence of any [[habitable planet]]s.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Mensa contains part of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (the rest being in [[Dorado]]).{{fact|date=October 2013}}

The first images taken by the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] were of [[PKS 0637-752]], a [[quasar]] in Mensa with a large gas jet visible in both optical and [[x-ray]] [[wavelength]]s.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

'''Sculptor''' is a small and faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It represents a [[sculptor]]. It was introduced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in the 18th century. He originally named it '''Apparatus Sculptoris''' (the sculptor's studio), but the name was later shortened.

==Characteristics==
Sculptor is a small constellation bordered by [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and [[Cetus]] to the north, [[Fornax]] to the east, [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] to the south, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] to the southwest, and [[Piscis Austrinus]] to the west.

No stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude|3rd magnitude]] are located in Sculptor. This is explained by the fact that Sculptor contains the [[Galactic coordinate system|south galactic pole]] where stellar density is very low.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The brightest star is [[Alpha Sculptoris]], an [[SX Arietis variable|SX Arietis-type]] [[variable star]] with a spectral type B7IIIp and an apparent magnitude of 4.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Alpha+scl&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = Alpha Sculptoris– Rotationally Variable Star |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R Sculptoris]] is a [[red giant]] that has been found to be surrounded by spirals of matter likely ejected around 1800 years ago.

The constellation also contains the [[Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy|Sculptor Dwarf]], a [[dwarf galaxy]] which is a member of the [[Local Group]], as well as the [[Sculptor Group]], the group of galaxies closest to the Local Group. The [[Sculptor Galaxy]] (NGC 253), a [[barred spiral galaxy]] and the largest member of the group, lies near the border between Sculptor and [[Cetus]]. Another prominent member of the group is the [[irregular galaxy]] [[NGC 55]].

One unique galaxy in Sculptor is the [[Cartwheel Galaxy]], at a distance of 500 million [[light-years]]. The result of a [[galaxy merger|merger]] around 300 million years ago, the Cartwheel Galaxy has a core of older, yellow stars, and an outer ring of younger, blue stars, which has a diameter of 100,000 light-years. The smaller galaxy in the collision is now incorporated into the core, after moving from a distance of 250,000 light-years. The shock waves from the collision sparked extensive [[star formation]] in the outer ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesakes==
[[USS Sculptor (AK-103)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

'''Ursa Minor''' ([[Latin]]: &quot;Smaller Bear&quot;, contrasting with [[Ursa Major]]), also known as the '''Little Bear''', is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Like the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the name '''Little Dipper'''. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 [[List of constellations|modern constellations]]. Ursa Minor is notable as the location of the north [[celestial pole]], although this will change after some centuries due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

[[Polaris]], the brightest star in the constellation, is a yellow-white [[supergiant]] and brightest [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] [[variable star]], ranging from apparent magnitude 1.97 to 2.00. [[Beta Ursae Minoris]] is only slightly fainter, with its apparent magnitude of 2.08. Also known as Kochab, it is an orange giant star, 16 degrees from Polaris. It and magnitude 3 [[Gamma Ursae Minoris]] have been called the 'guardians of the pole star'. Three stellar systems have been discovered to contain planets.

==History and mythology==
[[Image:Dracourania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ursa Minor, with Draco looping around it, as depicted in Urania's Mirror,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm |title=Urania’s Mirror c.1825 – Ian Ridpath's Old Star Atlases |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]
Ursa Minor is commonly visualized as a baby bear with an unusually long tail. 

Ursa Minor and [[Ursa Major]] were related by the Greeks to the myth of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] and [[Arcas]].  However, in a variant of the story, in which it is [[Boötes]] that represents Arcas, Ursa Minor represents a dog. This is the older tradition, which sensibly explains both the length of the tail and the obsolete alternate name of ''Cynosura'' (the dog's tail) for Polaris, the North Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|author=Allen, Richard Hinckley|year=1969|publisher=Dover Publications Inc. (Reprint of 1899 original)|isbn=0-486-21079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Ursa Minor was considered just seven close stars, mythologically regarded as sisters. In early [[Greek mythology]], the seven stars of the Little Dipper were the [[Hesperides]], daughters of Atlas. Together with the nearby constellations of  Boötes, Ursa Major, and Draco, it may have formed the origin of the myth of the apples of the Hesperides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/draco-constellation/|title=Draco Constellation|publisher=Constellation Guide}}, Retrieved 2013-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; which forms part of the [[Labours of Hercules]].{{Or|date=December 2008}} Ursa Minor with its modern associations was invented by [[Thales of Miletus]] in approximately 600 BCE, from what had previously represented the wings of Draco, the Dragon. He did so out of a desire to commemorate the location of the [[North Celestial Pole]], then near Beta and Gamma Ursae Minoris.{{sfn|Schaaf|2013}}

In Hungarian mythology the constellation is called 'Little Goncol cart' (Göncöl szekér) after a legendary shaman. (Ursa Major is 'Big Goncol cart.') The shaman's knowledge knew no limit. He invented the cart: His nation was wandering, so the cart was the biggest gift of the Gods to the country. Legends claim he knew everything about the world. Nobody saw his death; his body simply disappeared among the stars.

Because Ursa Minor consists of seven stars, the [[Latin]] word for &quot;[[North]]&quot; (i.e. where Polaris points) is ''septentrio'', from ''septem'' ([[7 (number)|seven]]) and ''triones'' ([[oxen]]), from seven [[ox]]en driving a plow, which the seven stars also resemble.

==Characteristics==
Ursa Minor is notable as the location of the north [[celestial pole]], although this will change after some centuries due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Navigating the Night Sky: How to Identify the Stars and Constellations |author= Guilherme de Almeida|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-85233-737-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by [[Camelopardalis]] to the west, [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256&amp;nbsp;square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'UMi'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 22 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|08|41.4}} and {{RA|22|54.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates range from the North Celestial Pole south to 65.40°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ursa Minor, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#umi | accessdate=12 May 2014 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{seealso|List of stars in Ursa Minor}}
Ursa Minor is colloquially known as the Little Dipper because its seven brightest [[star]]s seem to form the shape of a dipper ([[Ladle (spoon)|ladle]] or scoop). The star at the end of the dipper handle is [[Polaris]], the North Star. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars that form the end of the &quot;bowl&quot; of the [[Big Dipper]], a nearby [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] found in the constellation [[Ursa Major]].

The four stars constituting the &quot;bowl&quot; of the little dipper are unusual in that they are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes.  Hence, they provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.

The German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters [[Alpha]] through [[Theta]] to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, while his countryman [[Johann Elert Bode]] subsequently added Iota to Phi. However, only Lambda and Pi remain in use, likely because of their closeness to the North Celestial Pole.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=312}}

Marking the Little Bear's tail,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=518}} [[Polaris]], or Alpha Ursae Minoris, the brightest star in the constellation, is a 'yellow-white' [[supergiant]] that varies between spectral types F7Ib and F8Ib,&lt;ref name=AAVSOpol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=37413 |title=Alpha Ursae Minoris |author=Otero, Sebastian Alberto |date=4 December 2007 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located around 430 light-years away from Earth.

===Deep-sky objects===
Ursa Minor is rather devoid of many deep-sky objects. A notable object is the [[Ursa Minor Dwarf]], a [[dwarf galaxy]], located in the area of the constellation.

'''Cygnus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ɡ|n|ə|s}} is a northern [[constellation]] lying on the plane of the [[Milky Way]], deriving its name from the [[Latin]]ized [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[swan]]. The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, it features a prominent [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the '''Northern Cross''' (in contrast to the [[Southern Cross]]). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. 

Cygnus contains [[Deneb]], one of the brightest stars in the night sky and one corner of the [[Summer Triangle]], as well as some notable X-ray sources and the giant [[stellar association]] of [[Cygnus OB2]]. One of the stars of this association, [[NML Cygni]], is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars currently known]]. The constellation is also home to [[Cygnus X-1]], an distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a [[black hole]]. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the [[Kepler Mission]] observing one patch of the sky, the patch is the area around Cygnus.

== History and mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Surrounding it are Lacerta, Vulpecula and Lyra.]]
In [[Greek mythology]], Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans. [[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Sparta]]n king [[Tyndareus]]'s wife, who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Clytemnestra]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}[[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cycnus|Cygnus]] was transformed into a swan.

The Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of [[Phaethon]], the son of [[Helios]] the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.  Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  According to the myth, Phaethon's  brother, Cycnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.  The gods were so touched by Cycnus's devotion to his brother that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen (2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 70 (ISBN 978-1931559386).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cycnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.

Together with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], Cygnus may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1963) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In non-western astronomy===
{{See also|Cygnus (Chinese astronomy)}}
In [[Polynesia]], Cygnus was often recognized as a separate constellation. In [[Tonga]] it was called ''Tuula-lupe'', and in the [[Tuamotus]] it was called''Fanui-tai''. Deneb was also often given a name. In [[New Zealand]] it was called ''Mara-tea'', in the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'' or ''Taurua-i-te-haapa-raa-manu'', and in the Tuamotus it was called ''Fanui-raro''. Beta Cygni was named in New Zealand; it was likely called ''Whetu-kaupo''. Gamma Cygni was called ''Fanui-runga'' in the Tuamotus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}

== Characteristics ==
A very large constellation, Cygnus is bordered by Cepheus to the north and east, Draco to the north and west, Lyra to the west, Vulpecula to the south, Pegasus to the southeast and Lacerta to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is 'Cyg'.&lt;ref name=pa30_469&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 28 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|19|07.3}} and {{RA|22|02.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 27.73° and 61.36°.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Cygnus, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cyg | accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Covering 804 square degrees and around 1.9% of the night sky, Cygnus ranks 16th of the 88 constellations in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson07&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Robert|author2=Thompson, Barbara|title=Illustrated Guide to Astronomical Wonders: From Novice to Master Observer|publisher=O'Reilly Media|location=Sebastopol, California|date=2007|pages=214-15|isbn=0596526857|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ymt9nj_uPhwC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=cygnus+degrees+16th+804&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PjGlUvyJE8PjoATC5YLABw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cygnus%20degrees%2016th%20804&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cygnus culminates at midnight on 29 June, and is most visible in the evening from the early summer to mid-autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson07&quot;/&gt;

Normally, Cygnus is depicted with Delta and Epsilon Cygni as its wings, Deneb as its tail, and Albireo as the tip of its beak.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

There are several [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s in Cygnus. In the 17th-century German celestial cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s star atlas the ''Uranometria'', Alpha, Beta and Gamma Cygni form the pole of a cross, while Delta and Epsilon form the cross beam. The nova P Cygni was then considered to be the body of Christ.&lt;ref name=wagman&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, Virginia  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stars ===
{{See also|List of stars in Cygnus}}

Bayer catalogued many stars in the constellation, giving them the [[Bayer designation]]s from Alpha to Omega and then using lowercase Roman letters to g. [[John Flamsteed]] added the Roman letters h,i,k,l and m (these stars were considered ''informes'' by Bayer as they lay outside the asterism of Cygnus), but were dropped by [[Francis Baily]].&lt;ref name=wagman/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt;

There are several bright stars in Cygnus. [[Alpha Cygni]], called Deneb, is the brightest star in Cygnus. It is a white [[supergiant]] star of spectral type A2Iae that varies between magnitudes 1.21 and 1.29,&lt;ref name=AAVSOalf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=13281 |title=Alpha Cygni |last=BSJ|date=4 January 2010|work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest and most luminous A-class stars known.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois-deneb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deneb.html |title=Deneb |author=Jim Kaler |date=26 Jun 2009 |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located about 3200 light-years away.&lt;ref name=&quot;earthsky&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/deneb-among-the-farthest-stars-to-be-seen |title=Deneb: A distant and very luminous star |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its traditional name means &quot;tail&quot; and refers to its position in the constellation. [[Albireo]], designated Beta Cygni, is a celebrated [[binary star]] among amateur astronomers for its contrasting hues. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1 and the secondary is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.1. The system is 380 light-years away and is divisible in large binoculars and all amateur telescopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois-albireo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/albireo.html |title=Albireo |author=Jim Kaler |work=Stars |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamma Cygni]], traditionally named Sadr, is a yellow-tinged supergiant star of magnitude 2.2, 1500 light-years away. Its traditional name means &quot;breast&quot; and refers to its position in the constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois-sadr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sadr.html |title=Sadr |author=Jim Kaler |date=30 Nov 2012 |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Cygni]] is another bright binary star in Cygnus, 171 light-years with a period of 800 years. The primary is a blue-white hued giant star of magnitude 2.9, and the secondary is a star of magnitude 6.6. The two components are divisible in a medium-sized amateur telescope.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois-deltacygni&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deltacyg.html |title=DELTA CYG |author=Jim Kaler |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth star in Cygnus above magnitude 3 is Gienah, designated [[Epsilon Cygni]]. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 72 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois-gienah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/gienahcyg.html |title=Gienah Cygni |author=Jim Kaler |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–37}}

There are several other dimmer double and binary stars in Cygnus. [[Mu Cygni]] is a binary star with an optical tertiary component. The binary system has a period of 790 years and is 73 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary, both white stars, are of magnitude 4.8 and 6.2, respectively. The unrelated tertiary component is of magnitude 6.9. Though the tertiary component is divisible in binoculars, the primary and secondary currently require a medium-sized amateur telescope to split, as they will through the year 2020. The two stars will be closest between 2043 and 2050, when they will require a telescope with larger aperture to split. The stars [[30 Cygni|30]] and [[31 Cygni]] form a contrasting double star similar to the brighter Albireo. The two are divisible in binoculars. The primary, 31 Cygni, is an orange-hued star of magnitude 3.8, 1400 light-years from Earth. The secondary, 30 Cygni, appears blue-green. It is of spectral type A5IIIn and magnitude 4.83, and is around 610 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://simbak.cfa.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=30+Cygni&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search |title = 30 Cygni – Variable Star |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 Cygni itself is a binary star; the tertiary component is a blue star of magnitude 7.0. [[Psi Cygni]] is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 7.5. [[61 Cygni]] is a binary star divisible in large binoculars or a small amateur telescope. It is 11.4 light-years from Earth and has a period of 650 years. Both components are orange-hued dwarf ([[main sequence]]) stars; the primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1. 61 Cygni is significant because [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] determined its [[parallax]] in 1838, the first star to have a known parallax.

Located near Eta Cygni is the [[X-ray]] source [[Cygnus X-1]], which is now thought to be caused by a [[black hole]] accreting matter in a binary star system. This was the first x-ray source widely believed to be a black hole.&lt;!--needs ''much'' more elaboration; probably most defining feature of constellation--&gt;

[[File:Albireo.jpg|thumb|right|The two component stars of Albireo are easily distinguished, even in a small telescope.]]

Cygnus also contains several other noteworthy X-ray sources. [[Cygnus X-3]] is a [[microquasar]] containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star]] in orbit around a very compact object,&lt;ref name=&quot;2Kim&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1088/0004-637X/772/1/41}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a period of only 4.8 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/182772}}&lt;/ref&gt;The system is one of the most intrinsically luminous X-ray sources observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerding&gt;{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361:20042452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, the system undergoes periodic outbursts of unknown nature,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fender&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02726.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during one such outburst, the system was found to be emitting [[muon]]s, likely caused by [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshak&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.54.2079}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the compact object is thought to be a [[neutron star]] or possibly a black hole,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdziarski&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1093/mnrasl/sls035}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible that the object is instead a more exotic stellar remnant, possibly the first discovered [[quark star]], hypothesized due to its production of cosmic rays&lt;ref name=&quot;Baym&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/0370-2693(85)91489-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cannot be explained if the object is a normal neutron star. The system also emits [[cosmic ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, and has helped shed insight on to the formation of such rays.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKeown&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/scientificamerican1185-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cygnus X-2]] is another [[X-ray binary]], containing an A-type giant in orbit around a neutron star with a 9.8 day period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crampton&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/130636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is interesting due to the rather small mass of the companion star, as most [[millisecond pulsar]]s have much more massive companions.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&gt;{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02862.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another black hole in Cygnus is [[V404 Cygni]], which consists of a [[K-type star]] orbiting around a black hole of around 12 solar masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahbaz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The mass of the black hole in V404 Cygni|last1=Shahbaz|first1=T.|journal=MNRAS|year=1994|volume=271|pages=L1–L14|bibcode=1994MNRAS.271L..10S|last2=Ringwald|first2=F.

A.|last6=Casares|first6=J.|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994MNRAS.271L..10S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black hole, similar to that of Cygnus X-3, has been hypothesized to be a quark star.&lt;ref name=Kovács&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15571.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[4U 2129+ 47]] is another X-ray binary containing a neutron star which undergoes outbursts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/340757}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is [[EXO 2030+ 375]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonC&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1086/587134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cygnus is also home to several [[variable star]]s. [[SS Cygni]] is a [[dwarf nova]] which undergoes outbursts every 7-8 days. The system's total magnitude varies from 12th magnitude at its dimmest to 8th magnitude at its brightest. The two objects in the system are incredibly close together, with an orbital period of less than 0.28 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Honey, W.B., et al. | title=Quiescent and Outburst Photometry of the Dwarf Nova SS Cygni |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=236 |year=1989 |pages=727–34 |bibcode=1989MNRAS.236..727H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chi Cygni]] is a [[red giant]] and the second-brightest [[Mira variable]] star at its maximum. It ranges between magnitudes 3.3 and 14.2, and spectral types S6,2e to S10,4e (MSe) over a period of 408 days;&lt;ref name=AAVSOchi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=13285 |title=khi Cygni |last=BSJ|date=4 January 2010|work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a diameter of 300 [[solar diameter]]s and is 350 light-years from Earth.

Cygnus is one of the constellations that the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler satellite]] surveyed in its search for [[extrasolar planet]]s, and as a result, there are about a hundred stars in Cygnus with known planets, the most of any constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;KeplerLocation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=NASA Staff|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/314125main_Kepler_presskit_2-19_smfile.pdf |title=Kepler: NASA's First Mission Capable of Finding Earth-Size Planets |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=February 2009 |accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable systems is the [[Kepler-11]] system, containing six [[transiting planet]]s, all within a plane of approximately one degree. With a spectral type of G6V, the star is somewhat cooler than the Sun.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
There is an abundance of [[deep-sky object]]s, with many [[open cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e of various types and supernova remnants found in Cygnus due to its position on the Milky Way. Some open clusters can be difficult to make out from a rich background of stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson07&quot;/&gt;

[[Messier 39|M39]] (NGC 7092) is an [[open cluster]] 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies. It is loose, with about 30 stars arranged over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} Another open cluster in Cygnus is [[NGC 6910]], also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent the bottom of the toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;/&gt;

Other open clusters in Cygnus include [[Dolidze 9]], [[Collinder 421]], [[Dolidze 11]], and [[Berkeley 90]]. Dolidze 9, 2800 light-years from Earth and relatively young at 20 million light-years old, is a faint open cluster with up to 22 stars visible in small and medium-sized amateur telescopes. Nebulosity is visible to the north and east of the cluster, which is 7 arcminutes in diameter. The brightest star appears in the eastern part of the cluster and is of the 7th magnitude; another bright star has a yellow hue. Dolidze 11 is an open cluster 400 million years old, farthest away of the three at 3700 light-years. More than 10 stars are visible in an amateur instrument in this cluster, of similar size to Dolidze 9 at 7 arcminutes in diameter, whose brightest star is of magnitude 7.5. It, too, has nebulosity in the east. Collinder 421 is a particularly old open cluster at an age of approximately 1 billion years; it is of magnitude 10.1. 3100 light-years from Earth, more than 30 stars are visible in a diameter of 8 arcseconds. The prominent star in the north of the cluster has a golden color, whereas the stars in the south of the cluster appear orange. Collinder 421 appears to be embedded in nebulosity, which extends past the cluster's borders to its west. Berkeley 90 is a smaller open cluster, with a diameter of 5 arcminutes. More than 16 members appear in an amateur telescope.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Guide Me, Cygnus |last = French |first = Sue |pages = 58–60 |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 6826]], the Blinking Planetary Nebula, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.5, 3200 light-years from Earth. It appears to &quot;blink&quot; in the eyepiece of a telescope because its central star is unusually bright{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=130–131}} (10th magnitude).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} When an observer focuses on the star, the nebula appears to fade out.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=130–131}} Less than one degree from the Blinking Planetary is the double star 16 Cygni.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

The [[North America Nebula]] (NGC 7000) is one of the most well-known nebulae in Cygnus, because it is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies, as a bright patch in the Milky Way. However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs – it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low [[surface brightness]]. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

To the south of [[Epsilon Cygni]] is the [[Veil Nebula]] (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995), a 5,000-year-old [[supernova remnant]] covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky -&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; it is over 50 light-years long.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} Because of its appearance, it is also called the [[Cygnus Loop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; The Loop is only visible in long-exposure astrophotographs. However, the brightest portion, NGC 6992, is faintly visible in binoculars, and a dimmer portion, NGC 6960, is visible in wide-angle telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

The Northern Coalsack Nebula, also called the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Cygnus Rift]], is a [[dark nebula]] located in the Cygnus Milky Way.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

[[File:Stars Brewing in Cygnus X.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]], a large region of star-formation in Cygnus.]]

The [[Gamma Cygni Nebula]] (IC 1318) includes both bright and dark nebulae in an area of over 4 degrees. [[DWB 87]] is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include [[Sharpless 2-112]] and [[Sharpless 2-115]]. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2–112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an [[O III]] (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2–115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern of light and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;/&gt; 

Also of note is the [[Crescent Nebula]] (NGC 6888), located between Gamma and Eta Cygni, which was formed by the [[Wolf-Rayet star]] [[WR 136|HD 192163]].

In recent years, amateur astronomers have made some notable Cygnus discoveries.  The &quot;[[Soap bubble nebula]]&quot; (PN G75.5+1.7), near the Crescent nebula, was discovered on a digital image by Dave Jurasevich in 2007.  In 2011, Austrian amateur Matthias Kronberger discovered a planetary nebula ([[Kronberger 61]], now nicknamed &quot;The Soccer Ball&quot;) on old survey photos, confirmed recently in images by the Gemini Observatory; both of these are likely too faint to be detected by eye in a small amateur scope.

But a much more obscure and relatively 'tiny' object—one which is readily seen in dark skies by amateur telescopes, under good conditions—is the newly discovered nebula (likely reflection type) associated with the star 4 Cygni (HD 183056): an approximately fan-shaped glowing region of several arcminutes' diameter, to the south and west of the fifth-magnitude star.  It was first discovered visually near San Jose, California and publicly reported by amateur astronomer Stephen Waldee in 2007, and was confirmed photographically by Al Howard in 2010.  California amateur astronomer Dana Patchick also says he detected it on the Palomar Observatory survey photos in 2005 but had not published it for others to confirm and analyze at the time of Waldee's first official notices and later 2010 paper.

[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] is the largest star-forming region in the Solar neighborhood and includes not only some of the [[Most luminous stars|brightest]] and [[List of most massive stars|most massive]] stars known (such as [[Cygnus OB2-12]]), but also [[Cygnus OB2]], a massive [[stellar association]] classified by some authors as a young [[globular cluster]].

More [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].

[[Cygnus A]] is the first [[radio galaxy]] discovered; at a distance of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy. In the [[visible spectrum]], it appears as an [[elliptical galaxy]] in a small [[galaxy cluster|cluster]]. It is classified as an [[active galaxy]] because the [[supermassive black hole]] at its [[active galactic nucleus|nucleus]] is accreting matter, which produces two [[astrophysical jet|jets]] of matter from the poles. The jets' interaction with the [[interstellar medium]] creates radio lobes, one source of radio emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carina''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|n|ə}} is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[keel]] of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of [[Argo Navis]] (the ship ''Argo'') until that constellation was divided into three pieces, the other two being [[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]] (the [[poop deck]]), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the sails of the ship).

== History and mythology ==
Carina was once a part of [[Argo Navis]], the great ship of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] who searched for the [[Golden Fleece]]. The constellation of Argo was introduced in [[ancient Greece]]. However, [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] divided the Argo into three component constellations in 1763, including Carina, the Keel.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo's [[Bayer designation]]s. Therefore Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Constellation Carina.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Carina as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

=== Stars ===
Carina contains [[Canopus]], a white-hued [[supergiant]] that is the second brightest [[star]] in the night sky at magnitude −0.72, 313 light-years from Earth. Alpha Carinae, as Canopus is formally designated, is a [[variable star]] that varies by approximately 0.1 magnitudes. Its traditional name comes from the mythological [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], who was a navigator for [[Menelaus]], king of Sparta.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

There are several other stars above magnitude 3 in Carina. [[Beta Carinae]], traditionally called Miaplacidus, is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.7, 111 light-years from Earth. [[Epsilon Carinae]] is an orange-hued giant star similarly bright to Miaplacidus at magnitude 1.9; it is 630 light-years from Earth. Another fairly bright star is the blue-white hued [[Theta Carinae]]; it is a magnitude 2.7 star 440 light-years from Earth. Theta Carinae is also the most prominent member of the cluster [[IC 2602]]. [[Iota Carinae]] is a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 2.2, 690 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

[[Eta Carinae]] is the most prominent [[variable star]] in Carina; it weighs in at approximately 100 [[solar mass]]es and is 4 million times as bright as the Sun.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}} It was first discovered to be unusual in 1677, when its magnitude suddenly rose to 4, attracting the attention of [[Edmond Halley]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} Eta Carinae is inside [[NGC 3372]], commonly called the Carina Nebula.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}} It had a long outburst in 1827, when it brightened to magnitude 1, only fading to magnitude 1.5 in 1828. Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of [[Sirius]]; it brightened to magnitude −1.5 in 1843. However, since 1843, Eta Carinae has remained relatively placid, having a magnitude between 6.5 and 7.9.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} However, in 1998, it brightened again, though only to magnitude 5.0, a far less drastic outburst. Eta Carinae is a [[binary star]], with a companion that has a period of 5.5 years; the two stars are surrounded by the [[Homunculus Nebula]], which is composed of gas that was ejected in 1843.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

There are several less prominent variable stars in Carina. [[1 Carinae]] is a [[Cepheid variable]] noted for its brightness; it is the brightest Cepheid that is variable to the unaided eye. It is a yellow-hued supergiant star with a minimum magnitude of 4.2 and a maximum magnitude of 3.3; it has a period of 35.5 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

Two bright [[Mira variable]] stars are in Carina: [[R Carinae]] and [[S Carinae]]; both stars are [[red giant]]s. R Carinae has a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 4.0. Its period is 309 days and it is 416 light-years from Earth. S Carinae is similar, with a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0. However, S Carinae has a shorter period&amp;nbsp;– 150 days, though it is much more distant at 1300 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

Carina is home to several [[double star]]s and [[binary star]]s. [[Upsilon Carinae]] is a binary star with two blue-white hued giant components, 1600 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0; the two components are distinguishable in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

Two [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are prominent in Carina. One is known as the 'Diamond Cross', which is larger than the Southern Cross (but fainter), and, from the perspective of the southern hemisphere viewer, upside down, the long axes of the two crosses being close to parallel.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Another asterism in the constellation is the [[False Cross]], often mistaken for the Southern Cross, which is an asterism in [[Crux]]. The False Cross consists of two stars in Carina, [[Iota Carinae]] and [[Epsilon Carinae]], and two stars in Vela, [[Kappa Velorum]] and [[Delta Velorum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===
Carina is known for its [[Carina Nebula|namesake nebula]], NGC 3372,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=100}} discovered by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1751, which contains several [[nebula]]e. The Carina Nebula overall is a colossal [[emission nebula]] approximately 8,000 light-years away and 300 light-years wide that possesses vast [[star formation|star-forming regions]];{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}} it has an overall magnitude of 8.0.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} It also has a massive apparent diameter, more than 2 degrees.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}} Its central region is called the [[Keyhole Nebula]], named in 1847 by [[John Herschel]]. The Keyhole is about seven light-years wide and is mostly made up of [[ionized hydrogen]], with two major star-forming regions. The [[Homunculus Nebula]] is a [[planetary nebula]] visible to the naked eye that is being ejected by the erratic [[luminous blue variable star]] [[Eta Carinae]], the most massive visible star known. Eta Carinae is so massive that it has reached the theoretical upper limit for the mass of a star and is therefore unstable. It is known for its outbursts; in 1840 it briefly became one of the brightest stars in the sky due to a particularly massive outburst, which largely created the Homunculus Nebula. Because of this instability and history of outbursts, Eta Carinae is considered a prime [[supernova]] candidate for the next several hundred thousand years because it has reached the end of its estimated million-year life span.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}}

Since the [[Milky Way]] runs through Carina, there are a large number of [[open cluster]]s in the constellation, embedded in rich star fields. [[NGC 2516]] is an open cluster that is both quite large–approximately half a degree square–and bright, visible to the unaided eye. It is located 1100 light-years from Earth and has approximately 80 stars, the brightest of which is a [[red giant]] star of magnitude 5.2. [[NGC 3114]] is another open cluster approximately of the same size, though it is more distant at 3000 light-years from Earth. It is more loose and dim than NGC 2516, as its brightest stars are only 6th magnitude. The most prominent open cluster in Carina is [[IC 2602]], also called the &quot;Southern [[Pleiades]]&quot;. It contains [[Theta Carinae]], along with several other stars visible to the unaided eye, in total, the cluster possesses approximately 60 stars. The Southern Pleiades is particularly large for an open cluster, with a diameter of approximately one degree. Like IC 2602, [[NGC 3532]] is visible to the unaided eye and is of comparable size. It possesses approximately 150 stars that are arranged in an unusual shape, approximating an [[ellipse]] with a dark central area. Several prominent orange giants are among the cluster's bright stars, of the 7th magnitude. Superimposed on the cluster is [[Chi Carinae]], a yellow-white hued star of magnitude 3.9, far more distant than NGC 3532.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104–106}}

Carina also contains the naked-eye [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 2808]]. [[Epsilon Carinae]] and [[Upsilon Carinae]] are double stars visible in small telescopes.

One noted [[galaxy cluster]] is [[1E 0657-56]], the Bullet Cluster. At a distance of 4 billion light years ([[redshift]] 0.296), this galaxy cluster is named for the [[bow shock|shock wave]] seen in the [[intracluster medium]], which resembles the shock wave of a supersonic bullet. The bow shock visible is thought to be due to the smaller galaxy cluster moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 3000–4000 kilometers per second to the larger cluster. Because this [[gravitational interaction]] has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years, the smaller cluster is being destroyed and will eventually merge with the larger cluster.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}}

=== Meteors ===

Carina contains the radiant of the [[Eta Carinids]] meteor shower, which peaks around January 21 each year.

== Equivalents ==

From China (especially northern China), the stars of Carina can barely be seen. The star Canopus (the south polar star in Chinese astronomy) was located by Chinese astronomers in the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''). The rest of the stars were first classified by [[Xu Guanggi]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]], based on the knowledge acquired from western star charts, and placed among [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'').{{clarify|date=December 2011}}

[[Polynesian people]]s had no name for the constellation in particular, though they had many names for Canopus. 
The [[Maori people|Maori]] name ''[[Ariki]]'' (&quot;High-born&quot;), .{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=201}} and the [[Hawaiian people|Hawaiian]] ''Ke Alii-o-kona-i-ka-lewa'', &quot;The Chief of the southern expanse&quot;. {{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=198}} both  attest to the star’s prominence in the southern sky, while the Maori ''[[Atutahi]]'', &quot;First-light&quot;  or &quot;Single-light&quot;, and the [[Tuamotu]] ''Te Tau-rari'' and ''Marere-te-tavahi'', &quot;He-who-stands-alone&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=229}} refer to the star’s solitary nature.
It was also called ''Kapae-poto'', (&quot;Short horizon&quot;), because it rarely sets from the vantage point of New Zealand;{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=217}} and ''Kauanga'' (&quot;Solitary&quot;), when it was the last star visible before sunrise.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=218}}

== Namesakes ==

{{USS|Carina|AK-74}} was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

'''Lepus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|p|ə|s}}, colloquially {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|p|ə|s}}) is a [[constellation]] lying just south of the [[celestial equator]], immediately south of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[hare]].  Although the hare does not represent any particular figure in [[Greek mythology]], Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located below the constellation Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion or, alternatively, by Orion's hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Skys &amp; Telescope: March 2008&quot;, ''Southern Hemisphere Highlights:'' by Shermend&lt;/ref&gt;

This constellation should not be confused with [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]], the wolf.

== History and mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Canis Major, Lepus, Columba Noachi &amp; Cela Sculptoris.jpg|left|thumb|Lepus as seen in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Lepus is most often represented as a rabbit being hunted by [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], whose hunting dogs ([[Canis Major]] and [[Canis Minor]]) pursue it. The constellation is also associated with some lunar mythology, including the [[Moon rabbit]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}}

Four stars of this constellation (α, β, γ, δ Lep) form a quadrilateral and are known as ''‘Arsh al-[[Orion (constellation)|Jawzā']]'', &quot;the Throne of Jawzā'&quot; or ''Kursiyy al-Jawzā' al-Mu'akhkhar'', &quot;the Hindmost Chair of Jawzā'&quot; and ''al-Nihāl'', &quot;the [[Camel]]s Quenching Their Thirst&quot; in [[Arabic]].

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Lepus}}
There are a fair number of bright stars, both single and double, in Lepus. [[Alpha Leporis]], the brightest star of Lepus, is a [[white supergiant]] of magnitude 2.6, 1300 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name, Arneb, means &quot;hare&quot;. [[Beta Leporis]], called Nihal, is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 2.8, 159 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Leporis]] is a double star divisible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.6, 29 light-years from Earth. The secondary is an orange star of magnitude 6.2. [[Delta Leporis]] is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.8, 112 light-years from Earth. [[Epsilon Leporis]] is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 2.2, 227 light-years from Earth. [[Kappa Leporis]] is a double star divisible in medium aperture amateur telescopes, 560 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.4 and the secondary is a star of magnitude 7.4.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}}

There are several [[variable star]]s in Lepus. [[R Leporis]] is a [[Mira variable]] star also called &quot;Hind's Crimson Star&quot; for its striking red color. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.8 to a maximum of 7.3, with a period of 420 days. R Leporis is at a distance of 1500 light-years. The color intensifies as the star brightens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Deep Sky Objects |last = Levy |first = David H. |publisher = Prometheus Books |year = 2005 |isbn = 1-59102-361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be as dim as magnitude 12 and as bright as magnitude 5.5. It was named for [[John Russell Hind]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}} T Leporis is also a Mira variable observed in detail by [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] [[Interferometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Unique Details Of Double Star In Orion Nebula And Star T Leporis Captured By 'Virtual' Telescope. ScienceDaily. Retrieved February 19, 2009, [http://www.sciencedaily.com­ /releases/2009/02/090218103517.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[RX Leporis]] is a [[semi-regular variable|semi-regular]] [[red giant]] that has a period of 2 months. It has a minimum magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}}

===Deep-sky objects===
There is one [[Messier Object]] in Lepus, [[Messier 79|M79]]. It is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 8.0, 42,000 light-years from Earth. One of the few globular clusters visible in the Northern Hemisphere winter, it is a Shapley class V cluster, which means that it has an intermediate concentration towards its center. It is often described as having a &quot;[[starfish]]&quot; shape. M79 was discovered in 1780 by [[Pierre Méchain]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=160-161}}

'''Sagittarius '''is one of the [[constellations]] of the [[zodiac]]. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and remains one of the [[List of constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[archery|archer]], and its symbol is [[File:Sagittarius.svg|20px]] ([[Unicode]] U+2650 ♐), a stylized arrow. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a [[centaur]] drawing a bow. It lies between [[Scorpius]] and [[Ophiuchus]] to the west and [[Capricornus]] to the east.

== Visualizations ==
[[File:Sagittarius-teapot-asterism.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|The &quot;Teapot&quot; asterism is in Sagittarius. The Milky Way is the &quot;steam&quot; coming from the spout.]]
As seen from the northern hemisphere, the constellation's brighter stars form an easily recognizable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as 'the [[Teapot]]'. The stars [[Delta Sagittarii|δ Sgr]] (Kaus Media), [[Epsilon Sagittarii|ε Sgr]] (Kaus Australis), [[Zeta Sagittarii|ζ Sgr]] (Ascella), and [[Phi Sagittarii|φ Sgr]] (Nanto) form the body of the pot; [[Lambda Sagittarii|λ Sgr]] (Kaus Borealis) is the point of the lid; [[Gamma Sagittarii|γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sgr]] (Alnasl) is the tip of the spout; and [[Sigma Sagittarii|σ Sgr]] (Nunki) and [[Tau Sagittarii|τ Sgr]] the handle (the closest bright star to the possible origin of the [[Wow! signal]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;deepsky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;skywatchers&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Outline of Sagittarius's &quot;teapot&quot; asterism against backdrop of Milky Way.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|The Teapot asterism in Sagittarius against the backdrop of the Milky Way. Note the &quot;steam&quot; rising from the Teapot's spout.]] --&gt;

Marking the bottom of the teapot's &quot;handle&quot; (or the shoulder area of the archer, are the bright star (2.59 magnitude) [[Zeta Sagittarii]] (ζ Sgr), named [[Ascella]], and the fainter [[Tau Sagittarii]] (τ Sgr).

To complete the teapot metaphor, under good conditions, a particularly dense area of the [[Milky Way]] can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like a puff of steam rising from a boiling kettle.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen (Sky Publishing 2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky (ISBN 978-1931559386).&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow, with the fainter stars providing the outline of the horse's body.  Sagittarius famously points its arrow at the heart of [[Scorpius]], represented by the reddish star [[Antares]], as the two constellations race around the sky.  Following the direct line formed by [[Delta Sagittarii]] (δ Sgr) and [[Gamma Sagittarii]] (γ Sgr) leads nearly directly to Antares.

Fittingly, Gamma Sagittarii is named [[Alnasl]], the Arabic word for &quot;arrowhead,&quot; and Delta Sagittarii is called [[Kaus Media]], the &quot;center of the bow,&quot; from which the arrow protrudes. Kaus Media bisects [[Lambda Sagittarii]] (λ Sgr) and [[Epsilon Sagittarii]] (ε Sgr), whose names Kaus Borealis and Kaus Australis refer to the northern and southern portions of the bow, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ridpath&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|title=Star Tales|year=1988|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|isbn=9780718826956|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the brightest star is [[Epsilon Sagittarii]] (ε Sgr) (&quot;Kaus Australis,&quot; or &quot;southern part of the bow&quot;), at magnitude 1.85.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Kaler, Prof. Emeritus of Astronomy, University of Illinois, http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sowlist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigma Sagittarii]] (σ Sgr) (&quot;Nunki&quot;) is the constellation's second-brightest star at magnitude 2.08. Nunki is a B2V star approximately 260 light years away.&lt;ref name=Chartrand /&gt; &quot;Nunki&quot; is a [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] name of uncertain origin, but thought to represent the sacred Babylonian city of [[Eridu]] on the [[Euphrates]], which would make Nunki the oldest star name currently in use.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;

[[Eta Sagittarii]] (η Sgr) is a double star with component magnitudes of 3.18 and 10, while [[Pi Sagittarii]] (π Sgr) is actually a triple system whose components have magnitudes 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0.&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

The Bayer designation [[Beta Sagittarii]] (Beta Sgr, β Sagittarii, β Sgr) is shared by two star systems, β¹ Sagittarii,  with apparent magnitude 3.96, and β² Sagittarii, magnitude 7.4. The two stars are separated by 0.36° in the sky and are 378 light years from earth. Beta Sagittarii, located at a position associated with the forelegs of the centaur, has the traditional name [[Arkab]], meaning &quot;achilles tendon.&quot;

=== Deep-Space objects ===
[[File:Omega Nebula.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|The Omega Nebula, also known as the Horseshoe or Swan Nebula.]]
The [[Milky Way]] is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the [[galactic center]] lies. Consequently, Sagittarius contains many [[star cluster]]s and [[nebula]]e.

==== Nebulae ====

Sagittarius contains several well-known nebulae, including the [[Lagoon Nebula]] (Messier 8), near λ Sagittarii; the [[Omega Nebula]] (Messier 17), also known as the [[Horseshoe Nebula]] or Swan Nebula, near the border with [[Scutum]]; and the [[Trifid Nebula]] (Messier 20), a large nebula containing some very young, hot stars.

* The [[Lagoon Nebula]] (M8) is an emission nebula that is located 5,000 light-years from Earth and measures 140 light-years by 60 light-years ([[celestial sphere|1.5°]]). Though it appears grey in telescopes to the unaided eye, long-exposure photographs reveal its pink hue, common to emission nebulae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt; It is fairly bright, with an integrated magnitude of 3.0.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=108}} The Lagoon Nebula was discovered independently by [[John Flamsteed]] in 1680,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=109}} [[Guillaume Le Gentil]] in 1747,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt; and [[Charles Messier]] in 1764.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=109}} The central area of the Lagoon Nebula is also known as the [[Hourglass Nebula]], so named for its distinctive shape. The Hourglass Nebula has its shape because of matter propelled by [[Herschel 36]]. The Lagoon Nebula also features three [[dark nebula]]e catalogued in [[Barnard's Catalog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt; The Lagoon Nebula was instrumental in the discovery of [[Bok globules]], as [[Bart Bok]] studied prints of the nebula intensively in 1947. Approximately 17,000 Bok globules were discovered in the nebula nine years later as a part of the [[Palomar Sky Survey]]; studies later showed that Bok's hypothesis that the globules held [[protostar]]s was correct.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=111–112}}

* The [[Omega Nebula]] is a fairly bright nebula; it has an integrated magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 1746 by [[Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux|Philippe Loys de Chésaux]]; observers since him have differed greatly in how they view the nebula, hence its myriad of names. Most often viewed as a checkmark, it was seen as a swan by [[George F. Chambers]] in 1889, a loon by [[Roy Bishop]], and as a curl of smoke by [[Camille Flammarion]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=103}}

* The Trifid Nebula (M20, NGC 6514) is an emission nebula in Sagittarius that lies less than two degrees from the Lagoon Nebula. Discovered by French comet-hunter [[Charles Messier]], it is located between 2,000 and 9,000 light-years from Earth and has a diameter of approximately 50 light-years. The outside of the Trifid Nebula is a bluish [[reflection nebula]]; the interior is pink with two dark bands that divide it into three areas, sometimes called &quot;lobes&quot;. Hydrogen in the nebula is ionized, creating its characteristic color, by a central triple star, which formed in the intersection of the two dark bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt; M20 is associated with a cluster that has a magnitude of 6.3.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=114}}

* [[NGC 6559]] is a star forming region located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Sagittarius, showing both emission (red) and reflection (bluish) regions.

The grouping of the Lagoon Nebula, the Trifid Nebula, and [[NGC 6559]] is often called the ''Sagittarius triplet''.

In addition, several other nebulae have been located within Sagittarius and are of interest to astronomers.

* [[Messier 24|M24]], also called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, is a star cluster with an approximate magnitude of 3. About 9400 light-years away, it has a diameter of approximately 330 light-years. Embedded in M24 is [[NGC 6603]], a smaller star cluster that is very dense. [[NGC 6567]], a dim [[planetary nebula]], and [[Barnard 92]], a [[Bok globule]], are also nearby.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=143–144}}

* [[NGC 6445]] is a [[planetary nebula]] with an approximate magnitude of 11. A large nebula at over one [[arcminute]] in diameter, it appears very close to the [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6440]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=133}}

* [[NGC 6638]] is a dimmer globular at magnitude 9.2, though it is more distant than M71 at a distance of 26,000 light-years. It is a Shapley class VI cluster; the classification means that it has intermediate concentration at its core. It is approximately a degree away from the brighter globulars [[Messier 22|M22]] and [[Messier 28|M28]]; NGC 6638 is southeast and southwest of the clusters respectively.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=167–168}}

In 1999 a violent outburst at [[V4641 Sagittarii|V4641 Sgr]] was thought to have revealed the location of the closest known black hole to Earth,&lt;ref name=&quot;nrao&quot; /&gt; but later investigation increased its estimated distance by a factor of 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAX&quot; /&gt; The complex radio source [[Sagittarius A]] is also here. Astronomers believe that one of its components, known as [[Sagittarius A*]], is associated with a [[supermassive black hole]] at the [[Galactic Center|center of the galaxy]], with a mass of 2.6 million [[solar mass]]es.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=143}} The [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]] is located just outside the [[Milky Way]].

[[Baade's Window]] is an area with very little [[dust lane|obscuring dust]] that shows objects closer to the Milky Way's center than would normally be visible. [[NGC 6522]], magnitude 8.6, and [[NGC 6528]], magnitude 9.5, are both globular clusters visible through Baade's Window. 20,000 and 24,000 light-years from Earth, with Shapley classes of VI and V respectively, both are moderately concentrated at their cores. NGC 6528 is closer to the galactic core at an approximate distance of 2,000 light-years.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=174–175}}

== Mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Sagittarius and Corona Australis, Microscopium, and Telescopium.jpg|thumb|300px|Sagittarius as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.]]

The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god [[Nergal]], a strange centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot; /&gt; It is generally depicted with wings, with two heads, one panther head and one human head, as well as a scorpion's stinger raised above its more conventional horse's tail. The Sumerian name Pabilsag is composed of two elements&amp;nbsp;– Pabil, meaning 'elder paternal kinsman' and Sag, meaning 'chief, head'. The name may thus be translated as the 'Forefather' or 'Chief Ancestor'.&lt;ref name=&quot;White 2008 p155&quot; /&gt; The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius.

In [[Greek mythology]], Sagittarius is usually identified as a [[centaur]]: half human, half horse. However, perhaps due to the Greek's adoption of the Sumerian constellation, some confusion surrounds the identity of the archer.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;  Some identify Sagittarius as the centaur [[Chiron]], the son of [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] and [[Saturn]] and tutor to [[Jason]], who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. However, Chiron is in fact represented by the constellation [[Centaurus]], the other heavenly centaur.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt; An alternative tradition is that Chiron merely invented the constellation Sagittarius to help in guiding the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Moore (CRC Press 2010) The Data Book of Astronomy, p. 433 (ISBN 9781420033441.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A competing mythological tradition, as espoused by [[Eratosthenes]], identified the Archer not as a centaur but as the [[satyr]] [[Crotus]], son of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who Greeks credited with the invention of archery.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theony Condos, Ph.D. (Red Wheel/Weiser 1997) Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans: A Sourcebook, p. 186 (ISBN 9781609256784.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to myth, Crotus often went hunting on horseback and lived among the [[Muses]], who requested that [[Zeus]] place him in the sky, where he is seen demonstrating archery.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;

The arrow of this constellation points towards the star [[Antares]], the &quot;heart of the scorpion,&quot; and Sagittarius stands poised to attack should Scorpius ever attack the nearby [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], or to avenge Scorpius's slaying of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton D. Heifetz (Cambridge University Press 2004) A Walk Through the Heavens: A Guide to Stars and Constellations and Their Legends, p. 66 (ISBN 9780521544153).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vela''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[sail]]s of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship ''[[Argo Navis]]'', which was later divided into three or four parts, the others being [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Puppis]] and, according to some authorities, [[Pyxis]].&lt;ref&gt;John Scalzi (2008) Rough Guide to the Universe, p. 240 (ISBN 9781405383707).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David H. Kelley, et al. (2011) Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy , p. 12  (9781441976246).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Winterburn (2009) The Stargazer's Guide, p. 124 (ISBN 9780061976377).&lt;/ref&gt; With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star [[Gamma Velorum]], one component of which is the brightest [[Wolf-Rayet]] star in the sky. [[Delta Velorum|Delta]] and [[Kappa Velorum]], together with [[Epsilon Carinae|Epsilon]] and [[Iota Carinae]], form the [[asterism]] known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system.

==History==
[[Argo Navis]] was one of the 48 classical constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and represented the ship ''[[Argo]]'', used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] on their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] in [[Greek mythology]]. German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] depicted the constellation on his  ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, and gave the stars [[Bayer designation]]s from Alpha to Omega. However, his chart was inaccurate as the constellation was not visible from the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=wagman&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, [[Virginia|VA]]  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=83, 315–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argo was more accurately charted and subdivided in 1752 by the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], forming Carina, Vela, Puppis and Pyxis. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo's [[Bayer designation]]s. Therefore Carina has the Alpha, Beta and Epsilon, Vela has Gamma and Delta, and Puppis has Zeta, and so on.&lt;ref name=wagman/&gt;

Vela is bordered by [[Antlia]] and [[Pyxis]] to the north, [[Puppis]] to the northwest, [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] to the south and southwest, and [[Centaurus]] to the east. Covering 500 square degrees, it ranks 32nd of the 88 [[modern constellations]] in size.

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Vela}}
The brightest star in the constellation, [[Gamma Velorum]], is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Velorum or Regor, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.81.&lt;ref name=simbadregor&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Gamma+velorum&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = Gamma Velorum - Wolf-Rayet Stari |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.2 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 180,000 times as luminous,  is around 30 times as massive and is 13 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 32500 K. The second component is an extremely rare hot star known as a [[Wolf–Rayet star]], and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 to 70,000 K, and is around 100,000 times as luminous as our sun, though radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;kalerregor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/regor.html |title=Regor |last=Kaler|first=Jim|authorlink= James B.

===Brown dwarfs===

The discovery of a binary [[brown dwarf]] system named [[Luhman 16]] only 6.6 light years away, the third closest system to [[Solar system|Sol]], was announced on 11 March 2013.

===Deep-sky objects===
Of the [[deep-sky object]]s of interest in Vela is a [[planetary nebula]] known as the [[NGC 3132]], nicknamed the 'Eight-Burst Nebula' or 'Southern Ring Nebula' (see accompanying photo). It lies on the border of the constellation with Antlia.&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;/&gt; [[NGC 2899]] is an unusual red-hued example. This constellation has 32 more [[planetary nebula]]e.

[[File:NGC 3132.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Deep-sky photograph of [[NGC 3132]], also known as the Eight-Burst or Southern Ring Nebula. © NASA.]]

The [[Gum Nebula]] is a faint [[emission nebula]], believed to be the remains of a million-year-old supernova. Within it lie the smaller and younger [[Vela Supernova Remnant]]. This is the [[nebula]] of a [[supernova]] explosion that is believed to have been visible from Earth around 10,000 years ago.  The remnant contains the [[Vela Pulsar]], the first [[pulsar]] to be identified optically. Nearby is [[NGC 2736]], also known as the Pencil Nebula.

[[HH-47]] is a [[Herbig-Haro Object]]; a young star around 1400 [[light-year]]s from our Sun that is ejecting material at tremendous speed (up to a million kilometres per hour) into its surrounds. This material glows as it hits surrounding gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/632-alma-takes-close-look-at-drama-of-starbirth|title=ALMA Takes Close Look at Drama of Starbirth |last=Foncea |first=Valeria |coauthors=Arce; Héctor |date=20 August 2013|work=Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 2670]] is an [[open cluster]] located in Vela. It has an overall magnitude of 7.8 and is 3200 light-years from Earth. The stars of NGC 2670, a Trumpler class II 2 p and Shapley class d cluster, are in a conformation suggesting a bow and arrow. Its class indicates that it is a poor, loose cluster, though detached from the star field. It is somewhat concentrated at its center, and its less than 50 stars range moderately in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}}

[[NGC 3201]] is a [[globular cluster]] that was discovered by [[James Dunlop]] on May 28, 1826. Its stellar population is inhomogeneous, varying with distance from the core. The [[effective temperature]] of the stars shows an increase with greater distance, with the redder and cooler stars tending to be located closer to the core. As of 2010, is one of only two clusters (including [[Messier 4]]) that shows a definite inhomogeneous population.&lt;ref name=aaa512_L6&gt;{{citation | display-authors=1 | last1=Kravtsov | first1=V. | last2=Alcaíno | first2=G. | last3=Marconi | first3=G. | last4=Alvarado | first4=F. | title=Evidence of the inhomogeneity of the stellar population in the differentially reddened globular cluster NGC 3201 | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=512 | page=L6 |date=March 2010 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200913749 | bibcode=2010A&amp;A...512L...6K | postscript=. |arxiv = 1004.5583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phoenix''' is a minor [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]]. Named after the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  charted the brighter stars and gave their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° [[declination]], and from 23.5h to 2.5h of [[right ascension]]. The constellations Phoenix, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Tucana]], are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, [[Alpha Phoenicis]], is named Ankaa, an [[Arabic]] word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is [[Beta Phoenicis]], actually a [[Binary star|binary]] system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. [[Nu Phoenicis]] has a dust disk, while the constellation boasts ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered [[galaxy cluster]]s [[El Gordo (galaxy cluster)|El Gordo]] and the [[Phoenix Cluster]]—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the [[visible universe]]. Phoenix is the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of two annual [[meteor shower]]s: the [[Phoenicids]] in December, and the July Phoenicids.

==History==
[[File:Phoenix in Doppelmayr's Atlas Coelestis.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|The constellation Phoenix as depicted in [[Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr]]'s ''Atlas Coelestis'', ca. 1742.]]
[[File:Johann_Bayer_-_Uraniometria_-_Southern_Birds.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The &quot;southern birds&quot;, as depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]''. Phoenix is on the lower left.]]
Phoenix was the largest of the twelve constellations established by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]]|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name ''Den voghel Fenicx'', &quot;The Bird Phoenix&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's catalogue |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; symbolising the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] of classical mythology.&lt;ref name=ridpathphe&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/phoenix.htm | title=Phoenix – the Phoenix |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One name of the brightest star [[Alpha Phoenicis]]—Ankaa—is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''العنقاء''' ''al-‘anqā’'' &quot;the phoenix&quot;, and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Kunitsch, Paul; Smart, Tim |year= 2006 |title=A Dictionary of Modern Star names: A Short Guide to 254 Star Names and Their Derivations |publisher=Sky Publishing Corp. |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=49 |isbn=978-1-931559-44-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and [[La Caille]], Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, ''Al Ri'āl'', or as a griffin or eagle.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, ''Al Zaurak'', on the nearby river Eridanus.&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;/&gt; He observed, &quot;the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention.&quot;&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, [[Ankaa]] ([[Alpha Phoenicis]]), and stars from the adjacent constellation [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] to depict ''Bakui'', a net for catching birds.&lt;ref name=ridpathphe/&gt; Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] together were seen by [[Julius Schiller]] as portraying [[Aaron]] the High Priest.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; These two constellations, along with nearby [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Tucana]], are called the Southern Birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;binocs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore, Patrick|title=Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=2000|pages=48|isbn=0521793904|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Jvbtl2Vyxm4C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=phoenix+pavo+grus+tucana#v=onepage&amp;q=phoenix%20pavo%20grus%20tucana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by [[Fornax]] and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of [[Hydrus]] to the south, and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] to the east and southeast. The bright star [[Achernar]] is nearby.&lt;ref name=klepesta&gt;{{cite book|last=Klepešta|first=Josef|coauthors=Rükl, Antonín |title=Constellations |publisher=Hamlyn|year=1974|origyear=1969|pages=214–15|isbn=0-600-00893-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Phe'.&lt;ref name=pa30_469&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The new international symbols for the constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|23|26.5}} and {{RA|02|25.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Phoenix, constellation boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#phe | accessdate=23 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the [[equator]].

It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/cool-luminous-galaxy-cluster-identified-0815.html|title=Most massive and luminous galaxy cluster identified|last=Chu|first=Jennifer |date=15 August 2012 |work=MIT News|publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=25 August 2012|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger still is [[El Gordo (galaxy cluster)|El Gordo]], or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/H-12-008.html |title=NASA's Chandra Finds Largest Galaxy Cluster in Early Universe |author=Perrotto, Trent J.; Anderson, Janet; Watzke, Megan  |date=10 January 2012 |publisher= NASA |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2012/elgordo/ |title=El Gordo: NASA's Chandra Finds Largest Galaxy Cluster in Early Universe |author=Chandra X-ray Observatory |date=10 January 2012 |publisher= NASA |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteor showers===
Phoenix is the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of two annual [[meteor shower]]s. The [[Phoenicids]], also known as the December Phoenicids, were first observed on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the [[Short-period comet|short-period]] comet [[289P/Blanpain]]. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year.&lt;ref name=jenniskens&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenniskens |first=Peter |title=Meteor Showers and Their Parent Comets |year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QpajMuyXG8AC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=phoenicids+meteor+shower#v=onepage&amp;q=phoenicids%20meteor%20shower&amp;f=false |pages=387–88 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-521-85349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower is referred to as the July Phoenicids.&lt;ref name=&quot;levy08&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=David H.|authorlink=David H.

'''Lynx''' is a [[constellation]] in the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] sky, introduced in the 17th century by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. It is named after the [[lynx]], a [[genus]] of cat. It is a very faint constellation; its brightest stars form a zigzag line.

==History==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lynx and Tele Herschilii.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825). The obsolete constellation [[Telescopium Herschelii]] is to its right.]]
[[Johannes Hevelius]] defined the constellation in the 17th century because he wanted to fill the open gap between the constellations [[Ursa Major]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. He supposedly named it Lynx because of its faintness: only the lynx-eyed (or those of good sight) would have been able to recognize it.

According to Richard H. Allen, the chief stars in Lynx &quot;might well have been utilized by the modern constructor, whoever he was, of our Ursa Major to complete the quartette of feet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning , p. 280 (http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Lynx*.html).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==
The only named star in this constellation is [[Alsciaukat]] (from the [[Arabic]] for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, or κ Lyncis.

Lynx's most notable [[deep sky object]] is the [[Intergalactic Tramp]] NGC 2419, also called the &quot;Intergalactic Wanderer&quot;, a [[globular cluster]] that is one of the most distant known of its kind at a distance of 300,000 light-years from Earth. It is likely that NGC 2419 is in a highly elliptical orbit around the [[Milky Way]]. It has a magnitude of 10.3 and is a Shapley class II cluster; the classification indicates that it is extremely concentrated at its center. Originally thought to be a star, NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by [[Carl Lampland]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=168-169}}

==Namesakes==
Lynx has been used for the name of four [[United States Navy]] ships: [[USS Lynx (1814)]], [[USS Lynx (SP-2)]], [[USS Lynx (AK-100)]] and [[USS Lynx II (SP-730)]], of which only USS Lynx (AK-100) was named for the constellation.

'''Columba''' is a small, faint [[constellation]] created in the late sixteenth century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dove]]. It is located just south of [[Canis Major]] and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]].

==History==
[[Image:Constellation Columba.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Columba as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]Columba was created by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation [[Canis Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}} Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes.
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Canis Major, Lepus, Columba Noachi &amp; Cela Sculptoris.jpg|thumb|left|Seen as &quot;Columba Noachi&quot; in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Plancius originally named the constellation '''Columba Noachi''' (&quot;[[Noah]]'s Dove&quot;), referring to the dove that gave Noah the information that the [[Great Flood]] was receding. This name is found on early 17th-century celestial globes and star atlases (such as [[Johann Bayer|Bayer's]] [[Uranometria]] of 1603&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindahall.org/services/digital/ebooks/bayer/bayer88.shtml Canis Maior and Columba in Bayers Uranometria 1603 (Linda Hall Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;). Columba may also represent the dove released by [[Argonauts|Jason and the Argonauts]] at the [[Black Sea]]'s mouth; it helped them navigate the dangerous [[Symplegades]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}

Although the  Plancius is credited with the creation of Columba , the existence of a &quot;dove&quot; constellation was attested to by [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150-215), although it is not known whether the same group of stars was contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, pp. 166-168 &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Columba_Noae*.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, given the mythological linkage of Columba with Jason and the Argonauts, the celestial location of Columba over [[Puppis]], part of the larger constellation once known as [[Argo Navis]] (the ship of the Argonauts), supports an ancient derivation of this constellation, despite its notable omission by [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen (2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 126 (ISBN 978-1-931559-38-6).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chen, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Society Islands]], Alpha Columbae (Phaet) was called ''Ana-iva''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

==Notable features==
===Stars===
{{seealso|List of stars in Columba}}
Columba is rather inconspicuous, the brightest star, [[Alpha Columbae]], being only of magnitude 2.7. Alpha Columbae, a blue-white star, is traditionally called Phact, which means &quot;ring dove&quot;. Alpha Columbae is 268 light-years from Earth. The only other named star in Columba is [[Beta Columbae]], which has the name Wazn. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 86 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}

Columba is the constellation that is at the solar antapex - the Earth (and Sun) is moving away from its direction as the solar system moves through space.

The constellation contains the [[runaway star]] [[Mu Columbae|μ Columbae]], which was probably expelled from the [[Iota Orionis|ι Orionis]] system.

===Deep-sky objects===
There is one [[globular cluster]] in Columba, 7th-magnitude [[NGC 1851]]. It is 35,000 light-years from Earth and is resolvable in medium-sized amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}

'''Indus''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Created in the late sixteenth century, it represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of [[Asia]] or the [[Americas]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:Constellation Indus.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The constellation Indus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
Indus does not contain any bright stars. [[Alpha Indi]] is the brightest star in Indus. It is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 3.1, 101 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Indi]] is an orange giant of magnitude 3.7, 600 light-years from Earth. [[Delta Indi]] is a white star of magnitude 4.4, 185 light-years from Earth. 

[[Epsilon Indi]] is one of the closest stars to [[Earth]], approximately 11.8 [[light year]]s away. It is an [[orange dwarf]] of magnitude 4.7, meaning that the [[yellow dwarf]] [[Sun]] is slightly hotter and larger.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=162-163}} The system has been discovered to contain a pair of binary [[brown dwarfs]], and has long been a prime candidate in [[SETI]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Burnham |author2=Luft, Herbert A. | year=1978 | title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook: An Observer's Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | isbn=0-486-23568-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lawton | first=A. T. | title=CETI from Copernicus |journal=Spaceflight | year=1975 | volume=17 | pages=328–330 | bibcode=1975SpFl...17..328L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indus is home to one bright [[binary star]]. [[Theta Indi]] is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, 97 light-years from Earth. Its primary is a white star of magnitude 4.5 and its secondary is a white star of magnitude 7.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=162-163}}

[[T Indi]] is the only bright [[variable star]] in Indus. It is a [[semi-regular variable|semi-regular]], deeply coloured [[red giant]] with a period of 11 months, 1900 light-years from Earth. Its minimum magnitude is 7 and its maximum magnitude is 5.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=162-163}}

==History==
[[File:Johann_Bayer_-_Uraniometria_-_Southern_Birds.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Indus (top middle) in an extract from [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'', its first appearance in a celestial atlas.]]
The constellation was one of twelve created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=162-163}} and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Pegasus''' is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, named after the winged horse [[Pegasus]] in [[Greek mythology]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century [[astronomer]] [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

With an [[apparent magnitude]] varying between 2.37 and 2.45, the brightest star in Pegasus is the orange supergiant [[Epsilon Pegasi]], also known as Enif, which marks the horse's muzzle. [[Alpha Pegasi|Alpha]] (Markab), [[Beta Pegasi|Beta]] (Scheat), and [[Gamma Pegasi|Gamma]] (Algenib), together with [[Alpha Andromedae]] (Alpheratz or Sirrah) form the large [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the ''Square of Pegasus''. Twelve star systems have been found to have exoplanets.

==History==
The Babylonian constellation IKU (field) had four stars of which three were later part of the Greek constellation ''Hippos'' (Pegasus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thuston|first=Hugh|title=Early Astronomy|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-94822-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pegasus, in Greek mythology, was a winged horse with magical powers. One myth regarding his powers says that his hooves dug out a spring, [[Hippocrene]], which blessed those who drank its water with the ability to write poetry. Pegasus was the one who delivered [[Medusa]]'s head to [[Polydectes]], after which he travelled to [[Mount Olympus]] in order to be the bearer of thunder and lightning for [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he became the horse to [[Bellerophon]], who was asked to kill the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] and succeeded with the help of [[Athena]] and Pegasus. Despite this success, after the death of his children, Bellerophon asked Pegasus to take him to [[Mount Olympus]]. Though Pegasus agreed, he plummeted back to Earth after Zeus either threw a thunderbolt at him or made Pegasus buck him off.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staal|1998|pp=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Persia, Pegasus was depicted by [[al-Sufi]] as a complete horse facing east, unlike most other uranographers, who had depicted Pegasus as half of a horse, rising out of the ocean. In al-Sufi's depiction, Pegasus's head is made up of the stars of [[Lacerta]] the lizard. Its right foreleg is represented by β Peg and its left foreleg is represented by η Peg, μ Peg, and λ Peg; its hind legs are marked by 9 Peg. The back is represented by π Peg and μ Cyg, and the belly is represented by ι Peg and κ Peg.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

===In non-Western astronomy===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the modern constellation of Pegasus lies in [[Black Tortoise|The Black Tortoise of the north]] (北方玄武), where the stars were classified in several separate [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s of stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathcc&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/chinese.htm#lunar |work=Star Tales  | title=Charting the Chinese sky |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epsilon and Theta Pegasi are joined with [[Alpha Aquarii]] to form ''Wei'' 危 &quot;rooftop&quot;, with Theta forming the roof apex.{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|pp=233-34}} 

In Hindu astronomy, the Great Square of Pegasus contained the 26th and 27th [[lunar mansion]]s. More specifically, it represented a bedstead that was a resting place for the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

[[Warrau]] and [[Arawak]] peoples in [[Guyana]] used the stars in the Great Square to represent a grill on stilts.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Pegasus is bordered by Andromeda to the north and east, [[Lacerta]] to the north, [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] to the northwest, [[Vulpecula]], [[Delphinus]] and [[Equuleus]] to the west, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] to the south and [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] to the south and east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is 'Peg'.&lt;ref name=pa30_469&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 35 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|21|12.6}} and {{RA|00|14.6}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 2.33° and 36.61°.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Pegasus, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#peg | accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Covering 1121 square degrees, Pegasus ranks 7th of the 88 constellations in size.

The horses appear upside-down in relation to the constellations around them.]]

Pegasus is dominated by an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in the shape of a rough square, although one of the stars, [[Alpha Andromedae|Delta Pegasi]] or Sirrah, is now officially considered to be part of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], (α Andromedae) and is more usually called &quot;Alpheratz&quot;. Traditionally, the body of the horse consists of a quadrilateral formed by the stars [[Alpha Pegasi|α Peg]], [[Beta Pegasi|β Peg]], [[Gamma Pegasi|γ Peg]], and [[Alpha Andromedae|α And]]. The front legs of the winged horse are formed by two crooked lines of stars, one leading from [[Eta Pegasi|η Peg]] to [[Kappa Pegasi|κ Peg]] and the other from [[Mu Pegasi|μ Peg]] to 1 Pegasi. Another crooked line of stars from [[Alpha Pegasi|α Peg]] via [[Theta Pegasi|θ Peg]] to [[Epsilon Pegasi|ε Peg]] forms the neck and head; ε is the snout.

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Pegasus}}
Bayer  catalogued what he counted as 23 stars in the constellation, giving them the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha to Psi. He saw Pi Pegasi as one star, and was uncertain of its brightness, wavering between magnitude 4 and 5. Flamsteed labelled this star 29 Pegasi, but Bode concluded that the stars 27 and 29 Pegasi should be Pi1 and Pi2 and that Bayer had seen them as a single star.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=235}} Flamsteed added lower case letters e through to y, omitting A to D as they had been used on Bayer's chart to designate neighbouring constellations and the equator.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=236}} He number 89 stars with Flamsteed designations, though 6 and 11 turned out to be stars in Aquarius.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=448}}

[[Epsilon Pegasi]], also known as Enif, marks the horse's muzzle. The brightest star in Pegasus, is an orange supergiant of spectral type K21b that is around [[solar mass|12 times as massive]] as the [[Sun]] and lies around 690 [[light-year]]s distant from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=eps+peg&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = Epsilon Pegasi -- Pulsating Variable Star |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an irregular variable, its [[apparent magnitude]] varying between 2.37 and 2.45.&lt;ref name=AAVSOeps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=25522 |title=Epsilon Pegasi |author =Otero, Sebastian Alberto|date=7 June 2011 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lying near Enif is [[AG Pegasi]], an unusual star that brightened to magnitude 6.0 around 1885 before dimming to magnitude 9. It is composed of a [[red giant]] and [[white dwarf]], estimated to be around 2.5 and 0.6 times the mass of the Sun respectively. With its outburst taking over 150 years, it has been described as the slowest [[nova]] ever recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;kenyon93&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kenyon, Scott J.; Mikolajewska, Joanna; Mikolajewski, Maciej; Polidan, Ronald S.; Slovak, Mark H.|title=Evolution of the symbiotic binary system AG Pegasi - The slowest classical nova eruption ever recorded|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=106|issue=4|pages=1573-98|bibcode=1993AJ....106.1573K|year=1993|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1993AJ....106.1573K&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt;

Shining with an apparent magnitude of  2.94, it is a multiple star system composed of a yellow giant of spectral type G2 and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type A5V that are 3.2 and 2.0 times as massive as our Sun. The two revolve around each other every 2.24 years. Farther afield is a binary system of two G-type main sequence stars, that would take 170,000 years to orbit the main pair if they are in fact related.&lt;ref name=Kalereta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/matar.html | title=Matar (Eta Pegasi) | work=Stars | first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | publisher=University of Illinois | accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[IK Pegasi]] is a close binary comprising an [[A-type main-sequence star]] and [[white dwarf]] in very close orbit; the latter a candidate for a future [[type Ia supernova]] as its main star runs out of core hydrogen fuel and expands into a giant and transfers material to the smaller star.

Twelve star systems have been found to have exoplanets. [[51 Pegasi]] was the first Sun-like star discovered to have an [[exoplanet]] companion; [[51 Pegasi b]] (unofficially named Bellerophon) is a [[hot Jupiter]] close to its sun, completing an orbit every four days. Spectroscopic analysis of [[HD 209458 b]], an [[extrasolar planet]] in this constellation has provided the first evidence of atmospheric [[water vapor]] beyond the solar system, while extrasolar planets orbiting the star [[HR 8799]] also in Pegasus are the first to be directly imaged. [[V391 Pegasi]] is a hot subdwarf star that has been found to have a planetary companion.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[Messier 15|M15]] (NGC 7078) is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 6.4, 34,000 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class IV cluster, which means that it is fairly rich and concentrated towards its center. M15 was discovered in 1746 by [[Jean-Dominique Maraldi]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=157-158}}

[[NGC 7331]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] located in Pegasus, 38 million light-years distant with a redshift of 0.0027. It was discovered by musician-astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1784 and was later one of the first nebulous objects to be described as &quot;spiral&quot; by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|William Parsons]]. Another of Pegasus's galaxies is [[NGC 7742]], a Type 2 [[Seyfert galaxy]]. Located at a distance of 77 million light-years with a redshift of 0.00555, it is an [[active galaxy]] with a [[supermassive black hole]] at its core. Its characteristic emission lines are produced by gas moving at high speeds around the central black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;AO&quot;/&gt;

Pegasus is also noted for its more unusual galaxies and exotic objects. [[Einstein's Cross]] is a [[quasar]] that has been [[gravitational lensing|lensed]] by a foreground galaxy. The [[elliptical galaxy]] is 400 million light-years away with a [[redshift]] of 0.0394, but the quasar is 8 billion light-years away. The lensed quasar resembles a cross because the gravitational force of the foreground galaxy on its light creates four images of the quasar.&lt;ref name=&quot;AO&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=300 Astronomical Objects |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2=Robert |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephan's Quintet]] is another unique object located in Pegasus. It is a cluster of five galaxies at a distance of 300 million light-years and a redshift of 0.0215. First discovered by [[Édouard Stephan]], a Frenchman, in 1877, the Quintet is unique for its interacting galaxies. Two of the galaxies in the middle of the group have clearly begun to [[galactic collision|collide]], sparking massive bursts of star formation and drawing off long &quot;tails&quot; of stars. Astronomers have predicted that all five galaxies may eventually merge into one large elliptical galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AO&quot;/&gt;

===Meteor showers===
The [[Eta Pegasids]] radiate from the area near [[Eta Pegasi]] every year on May 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

'''Hydra''' is the largest of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, measuring 1303 square degrees. Also one of the longest at over 100 degrees, its southern end abuts [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] and [[Centaurus (constellation)|Centaurus]] and its northern end borders [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}} It has a long history, having been included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. It is commonly represented as a [[water snake (disambiguation)|water snake]]. It should not be confused with the similarly named constellation of [[Hydrus]].

=== Stars ===
Despite its size, Hydra contains only one reasonably bright [[star]], [[Alphard]], designated Alpha Hydrae. It is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 2.0, 177 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the solitary one&quot;. [[Beta Hydrae]] is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.3, 365 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Hydrae]] is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 3.0, 132 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}

Hydra has one bright [[binary star]], [[Epsilon Hydrae]], which is difficult to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. [[27 Hydrae]] is a triple star with two components visible in binoculars and three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}} N Hydrae (N Hya) is a pair of stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (Σ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.

The other main named star in Hydra is Sigma, σ, Hydrae, which also has the name of Minaruja, from the [[Arabic]] for snake's nose. At magnitude 4.54, it is rather dim. The head of the snake corresponds to the [[Āshleshā]] [[nakshatra]], the lunar zodiacal constellation in Indian astronomy.

Hydra is also home to several [[variable star]]s. [[R Hydrae]] is a [[Mira variable]] star 2000 light-years from Earth; it is one of the brightest Mira variables at its maximum of magnitude 3.5. It has a minimum magnitude of 10 and a period of 390 days. [[V Hydrae]] is an unusually vivid red variable star 20,000 light-years from Earth. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.0 to a maximum of 6.6. Along with its notable color, V Hydrae is also home to at least two [[exoplanets]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p={{page needed|date=August 2012}}}} [[U Hydrae]] is a semi-regular variable star with a deep red color, 528 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum magnitude of 4.2; its period is 115 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}

The constellation also contains the radio source Hydra A.

Hydra contains three [[Messier object]]s. [[Messier 83|M83]], also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is located on the border of Hydra and [[Centaurus]], [[Messier 68|M68]] is a [[globular cluster]] near M83, and [[Messier 48|M48]] is an [[open star cluster]] in the western end of the serpent.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}

[[NGC 3242]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of magnitude 7.5, 1400 light-years from Earth. Discovered in 1785 by [[William Herschel]], it has earned the nickname &quot;Ghost of [[Jupiter]]&quot; because of its striking resemblance to the giant planet.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=132–133}} 2600 light-years from Earth, tts blue-green disk is visible in small telescopes and its halo is visible in larger instruments.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}

[[Messier 48|M48]] (NGC 2548) is an open cluster that is visible to the naked eye under dark skies. Its shape has been described as &quot;triangular&quot;; this 80-star cluster is unusually large, more than half a degree in diameter, larger than the diameter of the [[full Moon]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}

There are several globular clusters in Hydra. [[Messier 68|M68]] (NGC 4590) is a globular cluster visible in binoculars and resolvable in medium amateur telescopes. It is 31,000 light-years from Earth and of the 8th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}} [[NGC 5694]] is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 10.2, 105,000 light-years from Earth. Also called &quot;Tombaugh's Globular Cluster&quot;, it is a Shapley class VII cluster; the classification indicates that it has intermediate concentration at its nucleus. Though it was discovered as a non-stellar object in 1784 by [[William Herschel]], its status as a globular cluster was not ascertained until 1932, when [[Clyde Tombaugh]] looked at photographic plates taken of the region near [[Pi Hydrae]] on 12 May 1931.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=173}}

[[Messier 83|M83]] (NGC 5236), the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is a 8th magnitude face-on [[spiral galaxy]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}} It is easily observed in skies south of 40°N latitude, found by using [[1 Centauri|1]], [[2 Centauri|2]], [[3 Centauri|3]], and [[4 Centauri]] as guide stars.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=38-40}}  It has been host to six [[supernova]]e, more than any [[Messier object]]. Large amateur telescopes - above 12 inches [[aperture]] - reveal its spiral arms, [[barred spiral galaxy|bar]], and small, bright nucleus.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–160}}{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=38-40}} In a medium-sized amateur instrument, around 8 inches in aperture, the spiral arms become visible under good conditions. It is not perfectly symmetrical in the eyepiece, rather, the northwest side is flattened and the nucleus has a southwest-to-northeast bar. A smaller sister to the Milky Way, it is a [[grand design spiral galaxy]] 40,000 light-years across.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=38-40}}

There are many other galaxies located in Hydra. [[NGC 3314]], usually delineated as NGC 3314a and NGC 3314b, is a pair of galaxies that appear superimposed, despite the fact that they are not related or interacting in any way. The foreground galaxy, NGC 3314a, is at a distance of 140 million light-years, and is a face-on spiral galaxy. The background galaxy, NGC 3314b, is an oblique spiral galaxy, and has a nucleus that appears reddened because of NGC 3314a's dusty disk.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=August 2012}}}} [[ESO 510-G13]] is a warped [[spiral galaxy]] located 150 million light-years from Earth. Though most galactic disks are flat because of their rate of rotation, their conformation can be changed, as is the case with this galaxy. Astronomers speculate that this is due to [[galaxy merger|interactions]] with other galaxies.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=August 2012}}}} [[NGC 5068]] may be a member of the M83 group, but its identity is disputed. It has a low surface brightness and has a diameter of 4.5 arcminutes. It is not perfectly circular, rather, it is elliptical and oriented on a west-northwest/east-southeast axis. However, it is of fairly uniform brightness throughout.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}}

=== Meteor showers ===
The [[Sigma Hydrids]] peak on December 6 and are a very active shower with an unknown parent body.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012|p=23}} The [[Alpha Hydrids]] are a minor shower that peaks between January 1 and 7.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012|p=24}}

== History and Mythology==

=== Western Mythology ===
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Uraniæ, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|300px|Hydra and surrounding constellations, from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
The Greek constellation of Hydra is an adaptation of a [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian constellation]]: the [[MUL.APIN]] includes a &quot;serpent&quot; constellation (MUL.DINGIR.MUŠ) that loosely corresponds to Hydra. It is one of two Babylonian &quot;serpent&quot; constellations (the other being the origin of the Greek [[Serpens]]), a [[mythological hybrid]] of serpent, lion and bird.{{sfn|White|2008|pp=89, 180}}

The shape of Hydra resembles a twisting [[snake]], and features as such in some Greek myths. One myth associates it with a water snake that a [[crow]] served [[Apollo]] in a cup when it was sent to fetch water; Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake, into the sky. It is also associated with the monster [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], with its many heads, killed by [[Hercules]], represented in [[Hercules (constellation)|another constellation]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=158–159}} According to legend, if one of the hydra's heads was cut off, two more would grow in its place.  However, Hercules burned out the roots of the heads he severed to prevent them from growing again, and thus overcame the hydra.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen (2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 44 (ISBN 978-1931559386).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mythology and Equivalents in Other Cultures ===

In Hindu Mythology the star that equivalents Hydra is [[Ashlesha]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.selfrealisation.net/UK/VedicAstrology/ashlesha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[Chinese constellations|Chinese astronomy]], the stars that correspond to Hydra are located within the [[Vermilion Bird]] and the [[Azure Dragon]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[culture]], the stars are known as Nuriko.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Pavo''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky with the [[Latin]] name for [[peafowl|peacock]]. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. Pavo first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]] and was depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603. French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] gave its stars [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. The constellations Pavo, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]], [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Tucana]] are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

The constellation's brightest member, [[Alpha Pavonis]], is also known as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] blue-white star, but is actually a [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic binary]]. [[Delta Pavonis]] is a nearby [[Sun]]-like star some 19.9 [[light years]] distant. Six of the [[star system]]s in Pavo have been found to host planets, including [[HD 181433]] with a [[Super-Earth|super-earth]], and [[HD 172555]] with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains [[NGC 6752]], the third-brightest [[globular cluster]] in the sky, and the [[spiral galaxy]] [[NGC 6744]], which closely resembles our [[Milky Way]] but is twice as large. Pavo is the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of two annual [[meteor shower]]s: the [[Delta Pavonids]] and [[August Pavonids]].

==History and mythology==

===History of the modern constellation===
[[File:Johan Doppelmayr's celestial chart of Pavo and Indus.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|The constellations Pavo and Indus featured in the chart of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere by [[Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr]] in his Atlas Coelestis, ca. 1742.]]
[[File:Johann_Bayer_-_Uraniometria_-_Southern_Birds.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Pavo (lower right), with the other southern birds, in its first appearance in a celestial atlas, [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]''.]]
Pavo was one of the twelve constellations established by Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].

The first depiction of this constellation in a [[celestial atlas]] was in German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart|work=Star Tales|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name ''De Pauww'', &quot;The Peacock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published|work=Star Tales  | accessdate= 23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate Latin name for the constellation was ''Junonia Avis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=James|title=A New Treatise on the Use of the Globes, and Practical Astronomy; or, A Comprehensive View of the System of the World|publisher=Smith &amp; Forman|location=New York, New York|year=1812|pages=42|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RU47AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Peacock in Greek mythology===

According to Mark Chartrand, former executive director of the [[National Space Institute]], Plancius may not have been the first to designate this group of stars as a peacock: &quot;In Greek myth the stars that are now the Peacock were Argos [or Argus], builder of the ship Argo. He was changed by the goddess Juno into a peacock and placed in the sky along with his ship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 172 (ISBN0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Mike Dixon-Kennedy (1998) Greco-Roman Mythology, pp. 45, 153 (ISBN 1-57607-129-4).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the peacock &quot;symboliz[ed] the starry firmament&quot; for the Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Cooper (Thames &amp; Hudson 1987) An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Traditional Symbols Paperback, p. 127 (ISBN 978-0500271254)&lt;/ref&gt; and the goddess Hera was believed to drive through the heavens in a chariot drawn by peacocks.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath (James Clark &amp; Co. 1988) Star Tales, p. 99 (ISBN 9780718826956).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peacock and the &quot;Argus&quot; nomenclature are also prominent in a different myth, in which [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a beautiful princess of Argos, was lusted after by [[Zeus]] (Jupiter). Zeus changed Io into a heifer to deceive his wife (and sister) [[Hera]] and couple with her. Hera saw through Zeus's scheme and asked for the heifer as a gift.  Zeus, unable to refuse such a reasonable request, reluctantly gave the heifer to Hera, who promptly banished Io and arranged for [[Argus Panoptes]], a creature with one hundred eyes, to guard the now-pregnant Io from Zeus. Meanwhile, Zeus entreated [[Hermes]] to save Io; Hermes used music to lull Argus Panoptes to sleep, then slew him. Hera adorned the tail of a peacock—her favorite bird—with Argus's eyes in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berens|first=E.M.|title=The Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome: A Handbook of Mythology|publisher=Europaeischer Hochschulverlag GmbH &amp; Co|location=Bremen, Germany|pages=26|isbn=978-3-86741-511-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5MGG8_rFhrkC&amp;pg=PA26| origyear=1894 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Greek Mythology.com, &quot;Io,&quot; at http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus_s_Lovers/Io_/io_.html (accessed 11/19/2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

As recounted in [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses]], the death of Argus Panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference: ''&quot;Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [Hera] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [the peacock, Pavo] and filled his tail with starry jewels.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.624.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain whether the Dutch astronomers had the Greek mythos in mind when creating Pavo but, in keeping with other constellations introduced by Plancius through Keyser and De Houtmann, the &quot;peacock&quot; in the new constellation likely referred to the [[Green Peafowl|Green Peacock]], which the explorers would have encountered in the East Indies, rather than the [[Blue Peafowl|Blue Peacock]] known to the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathpav&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/pavo.htm|work=Star Tales  | title=Pavo – the Peacock |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Constellation Pavo.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Pavo as it can be seen by the naked eye]]

'''Hydrus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|ə|s}} is a small [[constellation]] in the deep southern sky. It was first depicted on a [[celestial atlas]] by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  charted the brighter stars and gave their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. Its name means &quot;male water snake&quot;, as opposed to [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

The brightest star is the 2.8-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] [[Beta Hydri]], also the closest reasonably bright star to the [[pole star#Southern pole star (South Star)|south celestial pole]]. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, [[Gamma Hydri]] is a variable [[red giant]] some 60 times the diameter of our [[Sun]]. Lying near it is [[VW Hydri]], one of the brightest [[dwarf nova]]e in the heavens. Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date, most notably [[HD 10180]], which could bear up to nine planetary companions.

==History==
[[File:Johann_Bayer_-_Uraniometria_-_Southern_Birds.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Hydrus (lower right) in an extract from [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'', its first appearance in a celestial atlas.]]
Hydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/hydrus.html |title = Hydrus (Water Snake) |publisher = Chandra X-ray Observatory |accessdate =10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name ''De Waterslang'', &quot;The Water Snake&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it representing a type of snake encountered on the expedition rather than a mythical creature.&lt;ref name=ridphydrus&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/hydrus.htm | title=Hydrus—the Lesser Water Snake|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales| accessdate= 29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] called it ''l’Hydre Mâle'' on the 1756 version of his [[planisphere]] of the southern skies, distinguishing it from the feminine [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]]. The French name was retained by [[Jean Nicolas Fortin|Jean Fortin]] in 1776 for his ''Atlas Céleste'', while Lacaille [[Latin]]ised the name to Hydrus for his revised ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum'' in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title=Lacaille’s Southern Planisphere of 1756|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keyzer and de Houtman assigned 15 stars to the constellation in their Malay and Madagascan vocabulary, with a star that would be later designated as Alpha Hydri marking the head, Gamma the chest and a number of stars that were later allocated to Tucana, Reticulum, Mensa and Horologium marking the body and tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue of Southern Stars, and the Origin of the Southern Constellations | author= [[Edward Knobel|Knobel, Edward B.]] |journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 77| pages=414–32 [422] | bibcode = 1917MNRAS..77..414K |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1917MNRAS..77..414K/0000414.000.html |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha through to Tau in 1756.

===Deep-sky objects===
Hydrus contains only faint [[deep-sky object]]s. [[IC 1717]] was a deep-sky object discovered by the Danish astronomer [[John Louis Emil Dreyer]] in the late 19th century. However, the object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, and is now a mystery. It was very likely to have been a faint [[comet]].&lt;ref name=bagnall&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Philip M. |title=The Star Atlas Companion: What You Need to Know about the Constellations |publisher=Springer  |location=New York, New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4614-0830-7 |pages=251–52|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KcIg02TKW6QC&amp;pg=PA251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the white rose galaxy, [[PGC 6240]] is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from our Solar System.

'''Aquila''' is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for '[[eagle]]' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in [[Greco-Roman mythology]].

Aquila lies just a few degrees North of the [[celestial equator]]. The alpha star, [[Altair]], is a vertex of the [[Summer Triangle]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the [[Milky Way]]. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and [[planetary nebula|nebulae]] are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies.

==History==
[[Image:AquilaCC.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The constellation Aquila as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Delphinus, Sagitta, Aquila, and Antinous.jpg|thumb|left|The former constellation [[Antinous (constellation)|Antinous]] was merged into Aquilla in 1930, but both can be seen in this 1825 chart from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.]]
Aquila was one of the 48 [[constellation]]s described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. It had been earlier mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in the 4th century BC and [[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. The constellation was also known as ''Vultur volans'' (the flying vulture) to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], not to be confused with ''Vultur cadens'' which was their name for [[Lyra]]. It is often held to represent the eagle who held Zeus's/Jupiter's thunderbolts in [[Greco-Roman mythology]]. Aquila is also associated with the eagle who kidnapped [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]), to [[Mount Olympus]] to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

Ptolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of [[Antinous (constellation)|Antinous]], which was named in the reign of the emperor [[Hadrian]] (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Tycho Brahe]], who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] determined twenty-three stars in the first&lt;ref name=&quot;PA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://contentdm.lindahall.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/star_atlas&amp;CISOPTR=479 |title = Prodromus astronomiae |year = 1690 |pages=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nineteen in the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA&quot;/&gt;

The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2008|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Aquila}}
Aquila, which lies in the [[Milky Way]], contains many rich starfields and has been the location of many [[nova]]e.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Alpha Aquilae|α Aql]] (Altair)''' is the brightest star in this constellation and one of the closest naked-eye stars to Earth at a distance of 17 light-years. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;al-nasr al-tair&quot;, meaning &quot;the flying eagle&quot;. Altair has a magnitude of 0.76.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Beta Aquilae|β Aql]] (Alshain)''' is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.7, 45 light-years from Earth. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;shahin-i tarazu&quot;, meaning &quot;the balance&quot;; this name referred to Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Gamma Aquilae|γ Aql]] (Tarazed)''' is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.7, 460 light-years from Earth. Its name, like that of Alshain, comes from the Arabic for &quot;the balance&quot;, &quot;shahin-i tarazu&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Zeta Aquilae|ζ Aql]]''' is a blue-white-hued star of magnitude 3.0, 83 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Eta Aquilae|η Aql]]''' is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 1200 light-years from Earth. Among the brightest [[Cepheid variable star]]s, it has a minimum magnitude of 4.4 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5 with a period of 7.2&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[15 Aquilae|15 Aql]]''' is an [[optical double]] star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 5.4, 325 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-hued star of magnitude 7.0, 550 light-years from Earth. The pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[57 Aquilae|57 Aql]]''' is a [[binary star]]. The primary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 6.5. The system is approximately 350 light-years from Earth; the pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[R Aquilae|R Aql]]''' is a red-hued giant star 690 light-years from Earth. It is a [[Mira variable]] with a minimum magnitude of 12.0, a maximum magnitude of 6.0, and a period of approximately 9&amp;nbsp;months. It has a diameter of 400 D&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[FF Aquilae|FF Aql]]''' is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is a [[Cepheid variable star]] with a minimum magnitude of 5.7, a maximum magnitude of 5.2, and a period of 4.5&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Rho Aquilae|ρ Aql]]''' moved across the border into neighboring [[Delphinus]] in 1992.

===Novae===
Two major [[nova]]e have been observed in Aquila: the first one was in 389&amp;nbsp;BC and was recorded as being as bright as Venus; the other ([[V603 Aquilae|Nova Aquilae 1918]]) briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:IRAS 19024+0044.jpg|thumb|[[IRAS 19024+0044]] is a [[protoplanetary nebula]] in Aquila.]]
Three interesting [[planetary nebula]]e lie in Aquila:
*[[NGC 6804]] shows a small but bright ring
*[[NGC 6781]] which bears some resemblance with the [[Owl Nebula]] in [[Ursa Major]].
*[[NGC 6751]]: also known as the [[Glowing Eye]], a planetary nebula
More deep-sky objects:
*[[NGC 6709]] is a loose [[open cluster]] containing approximately 40 stars, which range in magnitude from 9 to 11. It is approximately 3000 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; It has an overall magnitude of 6.7 and is approximately 9100 light-years from Earth. NGC 6709 appears in a rich [[Milky Way]] star field and is classified as a Shapley class d and Trumpler class III 2&amp;nbsp;m cluster. These designations mean that it does not have many stars, is loose, does not show greater concentration at the center, and has a moderate range of star magnitudes.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=79-80}}
*[[NGC 6755]]: an [[open cluster]] of 7.5m; it is made up of about a dozen stars with magnitudes 12 through 13
*[[NGC 6760]]: a [[globular cluster]] of 9.1m
*[[NGC 6749]]: an [[open cluster]]
*[[NGC 6778]]: [[planetary nebula]]
*[[NGC 6741]]: [[planetary nebula]]
*[[NGC 6772]]: [[planetary nebula]]

===Other===
NASA's [[Pioneer 11]] space probe, which flew by [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] in the 1970s, is expected to pass near the star [[Lambda Aquilae|Lambda (λ) Aquilae]] in about 4&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=DK Eyewitness Space Encyclopedia |title =  Hardware, Leaving the Solar System:Where are they now?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
In illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair. The tips of the wings extend further to the southeast and northwest. The head of the eagle stretches off to the southwest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Mythology==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
[[Image:Aquilaurania.jpg|thumb|Aquila, with the now-obsolete figure of [[Antinous (constellation)|Antinous]], as depicted by [[Sidney Hall]] in ''Urania's Mirror'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm |title=Urania’s Mirror c.1825 – Ian Ridpath's Old Star Atlases |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. At left is [[Delphinus]].]]

According to Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man (LU.USH) in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the Classical stories of [[Antinous]] and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]].&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt;

In classical [[Greek mythology]], Aquila was identified as Αετός Δίας (''[[Aetos Dios]]''), the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of [[Zeus]] and was sent by him to carry the shepherd boy [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], whom he desired, to [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]]; the constellation of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] is sometimes identified with Ganymede.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

In the Chinese love story of [[Qi Xi]], Niu Lang ([[Altair]]) and his two children (β and γ Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu ([[Vega]]) who is on the far side of the river, the [[Milky Way]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In [[Hinduism]], the constellation Aquila is identified with the half-eagle half-human deity [[Garuda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref30lepig&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Research on Bengal: proceedings of the 1981 Bengal Studies Conference, Issue 34 of South Asia series, Michigan State University Asian Studies Center | author=Raymond L.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], [[Zeta Aquilae|ζ Aql]] is located within the [[Heavenly Market Enclosure]] (天市垣, ''Tiān Shì Yuán''), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').

There were several different [[Polynesia]]n equivalents to Aquila as a whole. On the island of [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]], it was called ''Kau-amonga'', meaning &quot;Suspended Burden&quot;. Its name references the Futunan name for Orion's belt and sword, ''Amonga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=218}} In [[Hawaii]], Altair was called ''Humu'', after the [[humu humu]] fish, and the whole constellation was called ''Humu-ma'', the &quot;Humu cluster&quot;. ''Humu-ma'' was said to influence the astrologers.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212}} ''Pao-toa'' was the name for the entire constellation in the [[Marquesas Islands]]; the name meant &quot;Fatigued Warrior&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=240}} There were also Polynesian constellations that incorporated the stars of modern Aquila. The [[Pukapuka]] constellation ''Tolu'', meaning &quot;three&quot;, was made up of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Aquilae.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=262}} Altair was commonly named among Polynesian peoples as well. The people of Hawaii called it ''Humu'', the people of the [[Tuamotus]] called it ''Tukituki'' (&quot;Pound with a hammer&quot;){{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=263}} - they named Beta Aquilae ''Nga Tangata'' (&quot;The Men&quot;){{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=256}} - and the people of Pukapuka called Altair ''Turu'' and used it as a navigational star.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=264}} The [[Maori people]] named Altair ''Poutu-te-rangi'', &quot;Pillar of the Sky&quot;, because of its important position in their cosmology. It was used differently in different Maori calendars, being the star of February and March in one version and March and April in the other. Altair was also the star that ruled the annual [[sweet potato]] harvest.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=245}}

==Namesakes==
Two [[United States Navy]] ships, [[USS Aquila (AK-47)]] and [[USS Aquila (PHM-4)]], are named after the constellation.

'''Virgo''' is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[virgin]], and its symbol is  Unicode ♍. Lying between [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] to the west and [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] to the east, it is the second largest constellation in the sky (after [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]]). It can be easily found through its brightest star, [[Spica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Spica.html The history of the star: Spica by Richard Hinckley Allen, 1889.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[Image:VirgoCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Virgo. [http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/virgo.html AlltheSky.com]]]

The bright [[Spica]] makes it easy to locate Virgo, as it can be found by following the curve of the [[Ursa Major|Big Dipper/Plough]] to [[Arcturus]] in [[Boötes]] and continuing from there in the same curve (&quot;follow the arc to Arcturus and speed on to Spica&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://souledout.org/nightsky/bigdippernavigation/bigdippernavigation.html |title=Night Sky~Big Dipper Navigation |publisher=Souledout.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the effects of [[precession]], the [[equinox|First Point of Libra]], (also known as ''the autumn equinox point'') lies within the boundaries of Virgo very close to [[Beta Virginis|β Virginis]]. This is one of the two points in the sky where the [[celestial equator]] crosses the [[ecliptic]] (the other being the [[First Point of Aries]], now in the constellation of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].) This point will pass into the neighbouring constellation of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] around the year 2440.

== Notable features ==

=== Stars ===
Besides Spica, other bright stars in Virgo include  [[Beta Virginis|β Virginis]] (Zavijava), [[Gamma Virginis|γ Vir]] (Porrima), [[Delta Virginis|δ Virginis]] (Auva) and [[Epsilon Virginis|ε Virginis]] (Vindemiatrix). Other fainter stars that were also given names are [[Zeta Virginis|ζ Virginis]] (Heze), [[Eta Virginis|η Virginis]] (Zaniah), [[Iota Virginis|ι Virginis]] (Syrma) and [[Mu Virginis|μ Virginis]] (Rijl al Awwa).

The star [[70 Virginis]] has one of the first known [[extrasolar planet|extrasolar planetary system]]s with one confirmed planet 7.5 times the mass of [[Jupiter]].

The star [[Chi Virginis]] has one of the most massive planets ever detected, at a mass of 11.1 times that of Jupiter.

The sun-like star [[61 Virginis]] has three planets: one is a [[super-Earth]] and two are [[Neptune]]-mass planets.

[[SS Virginis]] is a variable star with a noticeable red color. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.6 to a maximum of 6.0 over a period of approximately one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Deep Sky Objects |last = Levy |first = David H. |publisher = Prometheus Books |year = 2005 |isbn = 1-59102-361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exoplanets ===
There are 35 verified exoplanets orbiting 29 stars in Virgo, including [[PSR B1257+12]] (three planets), [[70 Virginis]] (one planet), [[Chi Virginis]] (one planet), [[61 Virginis]] (three planets), [[NY Virginis]] (two planets), and [[59 Virginis]] (one planet).

=== Deep-sky objects ===
Because of the presence of a [[Groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy cluster]] (consequently called the [[Virgo cluster]]) within its borders 5° to 12° west of ε Vir (Vindemiatrix), this constellation is especially rich in [[galaxy|galaxies]].

Some examples are [[Messier 49]] ([[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]]), [[Messier 58]] ([[spiral galaxy|spiral]]), [[Messier 59]] (elliptical), [[Messier 60]] (elliptical), [[Messier 61]] (spiral), [[Messier 84]] ([[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]]), [[Messier 86]] (lenticular), [[Messier 87]] (elliptical and a famous [[astronomical radio source|radio source]]), [[Messier 89]] (elliptical) and [[Messier 90]] (spiral). A noted galaxy that is not part of the cluster is the [[Sombrero Galaxy]] (M104), an unusual spiral galaxy. It is located about 10° due west of Spica.

[[NGC 4639]] is a face-on [[barred spiral galaxy]] located {{val|78|ul=Mly}} from Earth (redshift 0.0034). Its outer arms have a high number of [[Cepheid variable]]s, which are used as [[standard candle]]s to determine astronomical distances. Because of this, astronomers used several Cepheid variables in NGC 4639 to calibrate [[type 1a supernova]]e as standard candles for more distant galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

Virgo possesses several [[galaxy cluster]]s, one of which is [[HCG 62]]. A [[Hickson Compact Group]], HCG 62 is at a distance of {{val|200|ul=Mly}} from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0137) and possesses a large central elliptical galaxy. It has a heterogeneous halo of extremely hot gas, posited to be due to the [[active galactic nucleus]] at the core of the central elliptical galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messier 87|M87]] is the largest galaxy in the Virgo cluster, and is at a distance of {{val|60|u=Mly}} from Earth (redshift 0.0035). It is a major radio source, partially due to its jet of electrons being flung out of the galaxy by its central [[supermassive black hole]]. Because this jet is visible in several different wavelengths, it is of interest to astronomers who wish to observe black holes in a unique galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[Messier 84|M84]] is another elliptical [[radio galaxy]] in the constellation of Virgo; it is at a distance of {{val|60|u=Mly}} (redshift 0.0035) as well. Astronomers have surmised that the speed of the gas clouds orbiting the core (approximately {{val|400|u=km/s}}) indicates the presence of an object with a mass 300 million times that of the sun, which is most likely a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

The [[Sombrero Galaxy]], M104, is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 28 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0034). It has a [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] at its center made up of older stars that is larger than normal. It is surrounded by large, bright [[globular clusters]] and has a very prominent [[dust lane]] made up of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 4438]] is a [[peculiar galaxy]] with an [[active galactic nucleus]], at a distance of {{val|50|u=Mly}} from Earth (redshift 0.0035). Its supermassive black hole is ejecting [[polar jet|jets]] of matter, creating bubbles with a diameter of up to {{val|78|u=ly}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 4261]] also has a black hole {{val|20|u=ly}} from its center with a mass of 1.2 billion solar masses. It is located at a distance of {{val|45|u=Mly}} from Earth (redshift 0.0075), and has an unusually dusty disk with a diameter of {{val|300|u=ly}}. Along with M84 and M87, NGC 4261 has strong emissions in the [[radio spectrum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[IC 1101]] is a supergiant [[elliptical galaxy]] in the [[Abell 2029]] galaxy cluster located about {{val|1.07|u=Gly}} from Earth. At the diameter of 5.5 million light years, or more than 50 times the size of the [[Milky Way]], it was the largest known galaxy in the universe.

Virgo is also home to the [[quasar]] [[3C 273]] which was the first quasar ever to be identified. With a magnitude of ~12.9 it is also the optically brightest quasar in the sky.

== Mythology ==
According to the Babylonian [[Mul.Apin]], which dates from 1000–686 [[BCE]], this constellation was known as &quot;The Furrow&quot;, representing the goddess [[Shala]]'s ear of grain or corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUL.APIN |title=MUL.APIN - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One star in this constellation, [[Spica]], retains this tradition as it is [[Latin]] for &quot;ear of grain&quot;, one of the major products of the Mesopotamian furrow.  The constellation was also known as [[AB.SIN]] and [[absinnu]]. For this reason the constellation became associated with fertility.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONeil&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rNLoAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Virgo+%22the+furrow%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Virgo%20%22the%20furrow%22&amp;f=false ''Time and Calendars''], William Matthew O'Neil&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gavin White the figure of Virgo corresponds to two Babylonian constellations - the 'Furrow' in the eastern sector of Virgo and the 'Frond of Erua' in the western sector. The Frond of Erua was depicted as a goddess holding a palm-frond - a motif that still occasionally appears in much later depictions of Virgo.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks and Romans associated Virgo with their goddess of wheat/agriculture, [[Demeter]]-[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] who is the mother of [[Persephone]]-[[Proserpina]]. Alternatively, she was sometimes identified as the [[Lady Justice|virgin goddess ''Iustitia'']] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], holding the scales of justice in her hand as the [[Libra (constellation)|constellation Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Universe'', Martin Rees, General Editor. DK&lt;/ref&gt;  Another myth identifies Virgo as [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]], the daughter of [[Icarius of Athens]].   Icarius, who had been favoured by [[Dionysus]], was killed by his shepherds while they were intoxicated and Erigone hanged herself in grief; Dionysus placed the father and daughter in the stars as [[Boötes]] and Virgo respectively.  In the Middle Ages, Virgo was sometimes associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ONeil&quot;/&gt;

=== Astrology ===
{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Virgo from September 17 to October 30. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] from August 23 to September 22, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from September 16 to October 15.

== Visualizations ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Virgo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Virgo as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.]]

Virgo is often portrayed carrying two sheaves of wheat, one of which is marked by the bright star [[Spica]].

[[File:Virgo constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of [[H. A. Rey]]'s alternative way to connect the stars of the constellation Virgo.]]

[[H.A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to visualize Virgo, which graphically shows the virgin lying down in a [[supine position]].&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Rey, ''The Stars — A New Way To See Them''.  Enlarged World-Wide Edition.  Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1997.  ISBN 0-395-24830-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The stars [[Gamma Virginis|γ Vir]], [[Eta Virginis|η Vir]], [[Beta Virginis|β Vir]], [[Nu Virginis|ν Vir]], and [[Omicron Virginis|ο Vir]] form the virgin's head. The stars γ Vir, [[Delta Virginis|δ Vir]], [[Zeta Virginis|ζ Vir]], [[Spica|α Vir]] (Spica), and [[Theta Virginis|θ Vir]] form the virgin's blouse. The stars α Vir, ζ Vir, [[Tau Virginis|τ Vir]], [[Iota Virginis|ι Vir]], and [[Kappa Virginis|κ Vir]] form the virgin's skirt. The stars [[109 Virginis|109 Vir]] and [[Mu Virginis|μ Vir]] represent the Virgin's feet, and the star [[Epsilon Virginis|ε Vir]] represents the virgin's hand.

'''Aquarius''' is a [[constellation]] of the [[zodiac]],  situated between [[Capricornus]] and [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;water-carrier&quot; or &quot;cup-carrier&quot;, and its symbol is [[Image:Aquarius.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♒}}), a representation of water.

Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the [[zodiac]] (the [[sun]]'s apparent path).{{sfn|Rogers|1998|pp=9-28}} It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as [[Cetus]] the [[whale]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] the [[fish]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] the [[river]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007}}

==History and mythology==
Aquarius is identified as {{lang|sux-Latn|GU.LA}} &quot;The Great One&quot; in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and represents the god  [[Ea (god)|Ea]] himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the [[winter solstice]] in the Early Bronze Age.{{sfn|Thurston|1996}} In [[Old Babylonian astronomy]], Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the &quot;Way of Ea&quot;, corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007}} In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual [[flood of the Nile]]; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=42–44}}

In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to [[Piscis Austrinus]]. The name in the [[Hindu zodiac]] is likewise ''kumbha'' &quot;water-pitcher&quot;, showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|pp=9-28}}

In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with [[Deucalion]], the son of [[Prometheus]] who built a ship with his wife [[Pyrrha]] to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on [[Mount Parnassus]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007}}{{sfn|Star Tales}} Aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a youth in [[Greek mythology]] and the son of [[Troy|Trojan]] king [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]], who was taken to [[Mount Olympus]] by [[Zeus]] to act as cup-carrier to the [[Greek pantheon|gods]].{{sfn|Moore|2000}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}}{{sfn|Star Tales}} Neighboring [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] represents the eagle, under Zeus' command, that snatched the young boy;{{sfn|Rogers|1998|pp=79-89}} some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact Zeus transformed. An alternative version of the tale recounts Ganymede's kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn, [[Eos]], motivated by her affection for young men; Zeus then stole him from Eos and employed him as cup-bearer. Yet another figure associated with the water bearer is [[Cecrops I]], a king of [[Athens]] who [[sacrifice]]d water instead of [[wine]] to the gods.{{sfn|Star Tales}}

===In non-Western astronomy===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the &quot;Army of Yu-Lin&quot; (''Yu-lin-kiun'' or ''Yulinjun''). The name &quot;Yu-lin&quot; means &quot;feathers and forests&quot;, referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=42-44}}{{sfn|Star Tales}} The constellation's stars were the most numerous of any Chinese constellation, numbering 45, the majority of which were located in modern Aquarius. The celestial army was protected by the wall ''Leibizhen'', which counted Iota, Lambda, Phi, and Sigma Aquarii among its 12 stars.{{sfn|Star Tales}} 88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent ''Fou-youe'', the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions. Also in Aquarius is ''Loui-pi-tchin'', the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and Iota Aquarii to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and Epsilon Capricorni.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=42–44}}

Near the border with [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]], the axe ''Fuyue'' was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]]. ''Tienliecheng'' also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus. The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, ''Fenmu''. Nearby, the emperors' [[mausoleum]] ''Xiuliang'' stood, demarcated by Kappa Aquarii and three other collinear stars. ''Ku'' (&quot;crying&quot;) and ''Qi'' (&quot;weeping&quot;), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.{{sfn|Star Tales}}

Three of the Chinese [[lunar mansion]]s shared their name with constellations. ''Nu'', also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a [[handmaiden]] represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii. The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation ''Xu'' (&quot;emptiness&quot;), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals. ''Wei'', the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] and [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].{{sfn|Star Tales}}

===Depictions===
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Aquarius, Piscis Australis &amp; Ballon Aerostatique.jpg|left|thumb|350px|A representation of Aquarius printed in 1825 as part of ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', (including a now-obsolete constellation, [[Ballon Aerostatique]] south of it).]]
In the first century CE, [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' established the common Western depiction of Aquarius. His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and [[Zeta Aquarii]]; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with [[Fomalhaut]], now assigned solely to [[Piscis Austrinus]]. The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude [[25 Aquarii]] while his left shoulder is [[Beta Aquarii]]; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by [[Alpha Aquarii|Alpha]] and [[Gamma Aquarii]] respectively.{{sfn|Star Tales}}

===Stars===
Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2.{{sfn|Moore|2000}} However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess [[extrasolar planet|planetary systems]].

===Planetary systems===
Twelve exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013. [[Gliese 876]], one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years,{{sfn|APOD Gliese 876}} was the first [[red dwarf]] star to be found to possess a [[planetary system]]. It is orbited by four planets, including one [[terrestrial planet]] 6.6 times the mass of Earth. The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia Gliese 876}} [[91 Aquarii]] is an [[orange giant]] star orbited by one planet, [[91 Aquarii b|91&amp;nbsp;Aquarii&amp;nbsp;b]]. The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia 91 Aqr}} [[Gliese 849]] is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, [[Gliese 849 b|Gliese&amp;nbsp;849&amp;nbsp;b]]. The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia Gj 849}}

There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius. [[WASP-6]], a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, [[WASP-6 b]]. The star is 307 [[parsec]]s from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 [[solar mass]]es and a radius of 0.87 [[solar radius|solar radii]]. WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the [[transit method]]. It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU). It is 0.503 [[Jupiter mass]]es but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter radii]].{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-6}} [[HD 206610]], a K0 star located 194 parsecs from Earth, is host to one planet, [[HD 206610 b]]. The host star is larger than the Sun; more massive at 1.56 solar masses and larger at 6.1 solar radii. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method n 2010 and has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses. It orbits every 610 days at a distance of 1.68 AU.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 206610 b}} Much closer to its sun is [[WASP-47 b]], which orbits every 4.15 days only 0.052 AU from its sun, yellow dwarf (G9V) [[WASP-47]]. WASP-47 is close in size to the Sun, having a radius of 1.15 solar radii and a mass even closer at 1.08 solar masses. WASP-47 b was discovered in 2011 by the transit method, like WASP-6 b. It is slightly larger than Jupiter with a mass of 1.14 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.15 Jupiter masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-47 b}}

There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius. [[HD 210277]], a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: [[HD 210277 b]]. The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun - 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days. HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998. The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar [[spectral class]]; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 210277 b}} [[HD 212771 b]], a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star [[HD 212771]] at a distance of 1.22 AU. The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth. Though it has a similar mass to the Sun - 1.15 solar masses - it is significantly less dense with its radius of 5 solar radii. Its lone planet was discovered in 2010 by the radial velocity method, like several other exoplanets in the constellation.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 212771 b}}

As of 2013, there are only two multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and [[HD 215152]] systems. The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs. The HD 215152 system consists of the planets [[HD 215152 b]] and [[HD 215152 c]] orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun. Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star. HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses. The [[error]] in the mass measurements (0.0032 and 0.0049 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant. HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 215152 b}}{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 215152 c}}

===Deep sky objects===
[[File:The green bean galaxy J2240.jpg|thumb|The green bean galaxy J2240 lies in the constellation of Aquarius.{{sfn|ESO 2012}}]]

Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007}} Aquarius contains three [[deep sky object]]s that are in the [[Messier object|Messier catalog]]: the globular clusters [[Messier 2|Messier&amp;nbsp;2]], [[Messier 72|Messier&amp;nbsp;72]], and the open cluster [[Messier 73|Messier&amp;nbsp;73]]. Two well-known [[planetary nebula]]e are also located in Aquarius: the [[Saturn Nebula]] (NGC&amp;nbsp;7009), to the eastwest of [[Mu Aquarii|μ Aquarii]]; and the famous [[Helix Nebula]] (NGC&amp;nbsp;7293), southwest of [[δ Aquarii|δ&amp;nbsp;Aquarii]].

M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-[[aperture]] instruments, but a 100&amp;nbsp;mm aperture [[telescope]] is needed to resolve any stars. M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}} M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.

Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae. [[NGC 6781]] is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 11.0, 2500 light-years from Earth. It appears as a near-perfect ring in a rich star field; the field is so rich that several stars appear superimposed on the nebula. Like the [[Ring Nebula]] in Lyra, the ring is approximately 1 light-year in diameter.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=133-134}} [[NGC 7009]], also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth. It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer [[Lord Rosse]] for its resemblance to the planet [[Saturn]] in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble [[Saturn's rings]]. It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}} Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=132}} [[NGC 7293]], also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years. It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth. However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}} though it has a fairly high [[integrated magnitude]] of 6.0.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=131}}

One galaxy visible in Aquarius is [[NGC 7727]], also of interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe [[supernova]]e. A [[spiral galaxy]] ([[galaxy morphological classification|type S]]), it has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds.{{sfn|Sherrod|Koed|2003|p=222}}

===Meteor showers===
There are three major meteor showers with [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]]s in Aquarius: the [[Eta Aquariids]], the [[Delta Aquariids]], and the Iota Aquariids.

The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius. It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}} Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401 CE, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12. The [[parent body]] of the shower is [[Halley's Comet]], a [[periodic comet]]. [[Meteoroid#Fireball|Fireball]]s are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11. The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.{{sfn|Sherrod|Koed|2003|p=52}}

The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August. The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism. The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}}

The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}}

==Astrology==
{{Main|Aquarius (astrology)}}

{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] from 20 January to 19 February, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from 15 February to 14 March.

Aquarius is also associated with the [[Age of Aquarius]], a concept popular in [[1960s counterculture]]. Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the [[vernal equinox]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001}}

'''Musca''' ({{lang-la|[[fly]]}}) is a small [[constellation]] in the deep southern sky. It was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter [[globe#Celestial|celestial globe]] published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a [[Celestial cartography|celestial atlas]] was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603. It was also known as '''Apis''' ({{lang-la|[[bee]]}}) for two hundred years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

Many of the constellation's brighter stars are members of the [[Scorpius–Centaurus Association]], a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share a common origin and motion across the [[Milky Way]]. These include [[Alpha Muscae|Alpha]], [[Beta Muscae|Beta]], [[Gamma Muscae|Gamma]], [[Zeta2 Muscae|Zeta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and (likely) [[Eta Muscae]], as well as [[HD 100546]], a blue-white [[Herbig Ae/Be star]] that is surrounded by a complex [[debris disk]] containing a large [[exoplanet|planet]] or [[brown dwarf]] and possible protoplanet. Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two [[Classical Cepheid variable|Cepheid variables]] visible to the naked eye. [[Theta Muscae]] is a triple star system, the brightest member of which is a [[Wolf–Rayet star]].

[[File:BayerMusca.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Musca (as Apis) can be seen in the upper right of this extract from Bayer's ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603]]
Musca was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name ''De Vlieghe'', &quot;The Fly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assigned four stars to the constellation, with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head, Gamma the body, and Alpha and Delta the left and right wings respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue of Southern Stars, and the Origin of the Southern Constellations | author= [[Edward Knobel|Knobel, Edward B.]] |journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 77| pages=414–32 [426] | bibcode = 1917MNRAS..77..414K |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1917MNRAS..77..414K/0000414.000.html |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter [[globe#Celestial|celestial globe]] published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]], though was unnamed.&lt;ref name=musca/&gt; The first depiction of this constellation in a [[Celestial cartography|celestial atlas]] was in the German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; though Bayer termed it Apis—''the Bee'', a name by which it was known for the next two centuries.

The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] called it ''la Mouche'' on the 1756 version of his [[planisphere]] of the southern skies. [[Jean Nicolas Fortin|Jean Fortin]] retained the French name in 1776 for his ''Atlas Céleste'', while Lacaille [[Latin]]ised the name for his revised ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum'' in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacaille renamed it to ''Musca Australis'', the Southern Fly—''Australis'', since it counterparted the now [[former constellations|discarded constellation]] of [[Musca Borealis]] composed of a few stars in [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], and to avoid [[Apus|confusion with Apus]].

Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became [[Lambda Muscae|Lambda]] and [[Mu Muscae|Mu]] but did not designate them as he considered them ''informes'' as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. [[Francis Baily]] also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as [[Zeta1 Muscae|Zeta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Zeta2 Muscae|Zeta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation.&lt;ref name=wagman&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, Virginia  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=213–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites seven previous sentences --&gt; Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

'''Gemini''' is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[twin]]s,&quot; and it is associated with the twins [[Castor and Pollux]] in [[Greek mythology]]. Its symbol is [[File:Gemini.svg|18px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♊}}).

==Location==
[[File:GeminiCC.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The constellation Gemini as it can be seen with the naked eye, with added connecting lines.]]
[[Image:Gemini.gif|thumb|right|An [[animation]] of the [[constellation]] Gemini (center), &quot;the twins&quot;, shows two parallel stick figures. Gemini is associated with the [[myth]] of [[Castor and Polydeuces]] (also known as Pollux), collectively known as the [[Dioscuri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldwater.k12.mi.us/lms/planetarium/myth/Gem.gif K12.mi.us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constellation drawings (often but not always) following &quot;The Stars - A new way to see them&quot;, H.A. Rey, 1952–1980, ISBN 0-395-24830-2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Gemini lies between [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the west and [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] to the east, with [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] and [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] to the north and [[Monoceros]] and [[Canis Minor]] to the south.

The Sun resides in the astrological sign of Gemini from May 21 to June 20 each year. By mid August, Gemini will appear along the eastern horizon in the morning sky prior to sunrise. The best time to observe Gemini at night is overhead during the months of January and February. By April and May, the constellation will be visible soon after sunset in the west.

The easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] eastward from the familiar “V” shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the three stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]’s belt. Another way is to mentally draw a line from the [[Pleiades]] [[star cluster]] located in Taurus and the brightest star in [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], [[Regulus]]. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the [[ecliptic]], a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
The constellation contains 85 stars visible to observation on Earth without a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elijah H. Burritt|E H Burritt]] - [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3IQoAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=constellation+Gemini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Cd3oT-jRL4mwhAejqt2TDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=constellation%20Gemini&amp;f=false The geography of the heavens and class book of astronomy:  Accompanied by a celestial atlas] Huntington, 1840 Retrieved 2012-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Colbert|E Colbert]][http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z7gXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Gemini++85+stars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hcDqT8_EGOG_0QXRi_nWBQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Gemini%20%2085%20stars&amp;f=false Astronomy without a telescope: being a guide-book to the visible heavens, with all necessary maps and illustrations] George &amp; C.W. Sherwood, 1869 Retrieved 2012-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

The brightest star in Gemini is [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], and the second brightest is [[Castor (star)|Castor]]. Castor's [[Bayer designation]] as &quot;Alpha&quot; is attributable to a mistake by [[Johann Bayer]], who gave his [[Bayer designation|eponymous designations]] in 1603.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

'''[[Alpha Geminorum|α Gem ]] (Castor):''' the second brightest in the constellation after Pollux. Castor is a sextuple [[star system]] 52 light-years from Earth, which appears as a magnitude 1.6 blue-white star to the unaided eye. Two [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]] are visible at magnitudes 1.9 and 3.0 with a period of 470 years. A wide-set [[red dwarf]] star is also a part of the system; this star is an [[Algol variable|Algol-type]] [[eclipsing binary star]] with a period of 19.5 hours; its minimum magnitude is 9.8 and its maximum magnitude is 9.3. 

'''[[Beta Geminorum|β Gem]] (Pollux):''' the brightest star in Gemini, it is an orange-hued [[giant star]] of magnitude 1.2, 34 light-years from Earth. Pollux has an [[extrasolar planet]] revolving around it, as do two other stars in Gemini, [[HD 50554]], and [[HD 59686]]. 

'''[[Gamma Geminorum|γ Gem]] (Alhena):''' a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.9, 105 light-years from earth. 

'''[[Delta Geminorum|δ Gem]] (Wasat):''' a long-period binary star 59 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 3.5, and the secondary is an [[orange dwarf]] star of magnitude 8.2. The period is over 1000 years; it is divisible in medium amateur telescopes. 

'''[[Epsilon Geminorum|ε Gem]] (Mebsuta):''' a [[double star]], the primary is a [[yellow supergiant]] of magnitude 3.1, 900 light-years from Earth. The optical companion, of magnitude 9.2, is visible in binoculars and small telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

'''[[Zeta Geminorum|ζ Gem]] (Mekbuda):''' a double star, the primary is a [[Cepheid variable]] star with a period of 10.2 days; its minimum magnitude is 4.2 and its maximum magnitude is 3.6. It is a [[yellow supergiant]], 1200 light-years from Earth, with a radius that is 60 times solar, making it approximately 220,000 times the size of the [[Sun]]. The companion, a magnitude 7.6 star, is visible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes. 

'''[[Eta Geminorum|η Gem]]:''' a binary star with a variable component. 350 light-years away, it has a period of 500 years and is only divisible in large amateur telescopes. The primary is a [[semi-regular variable|semi-regular]] [[red giant]] with a period of 233 days; its minimum magnitude is 3.9 and its maximum magnitude is 3.1. The secondary is of magnitude 6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

'''[[Kappa Geminorum|κ Gem]]:''' a binary star 143 light-years from Earth. The primary is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 3.6; the secondary is of magnitude 8. The two are only divisible in larger amateur instruments because of the discrepancy in brightness. 

'''[[Nu Geminorum|ν Gem]]:''' a double star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes. The primary is a [[blue giant]] of magnitude 4.1, 500 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is of magnitude 8. 

'''[[38 Geminorum|38 Gem]]:''' a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, 91 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.8.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

'''[[U Geminorum|U Gem]]:''' a [[dwarf nova]] type [[cataclysmic variable star|cataclysmic variable]] discovered by [[J.R. Hind]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aavso.org/vsots_ugem |publisher = AAVSO |title = U Geminorum |accessdate = 7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
To look at Gemini is to look away from the [[Milky Way]]; as a result, there are comparatively few deep-sky objects of note. The [[Eskimo Nebula]] and [[Medusa Nebula]], [[Messier object]] [[Messier 35|M35]], and [[Geminga]] are those that attract the most attention. The Eskimo and Medusa nebulae are both [[planetary nebula]]e, the one approximately 2,870 [[light years]] away and the other 1,500 light years distant. M35 is an open [[star cluster]] which was discovered in the year 1745 by Swiss astronomer [[Philippe Loys de Chéseaux]]. And Geminga is a [[neutron star]] approximately 550 light years from [[Earth]]. Other objects of note are [[NGC 2129]], [[NGC 2158]], NGC 2266, NGC 2331, [[NGC 2355]], and NGC 2395.

[[Messier 35|M35]] (NGC 2168) is a large, elongated [[open cluster]] of magnitude 5; it has an area of approximately 0.2 [[square degree]]s, the same size as the [[full Moon]]. Its high magnitude means that M35 is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies; under brighter skies it is discernible in binoculars. The 200 stars of M35 are arranged in chains that curve throughout the cluster; it is 2800 light-years from Earth. Another open cluster in Gemini is [[NGC 2158]]. Visible in large amateur telescopes and very rich, it is more than 12,000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

The [[Eskimo Nebula]] or Clown Face Nebula (NGC 2392) is a planetary nebula with an overall magnitude of 9.2, located 4000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=126}} In a small amateur telescope, its 10th magnitude central star is visible, along with its blue-green elliptical disk. It is named for its resemblance to the head of a person wearing a [[parka]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}}

===Meteor showers===
The [[Geminids]] are a prominent, bright meteor shower that peaks on December 13–14. It has a maximum rate of approximately 100 meteors per hour, making it one of the richest meteor showers.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}} The Epsilon Geminids peak between October 18 and October 29 and have only been recently confirmed. They overlap with the [[Orionids]], which make the Epsilon Geminids difficult to detect visually. Epsilon Geminid meteors have a higher velocity than Orionids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 22 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Gemini.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Gemini as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.]]

In [[Babylonian astronomy]], the stars Castor and Pollux were known as the Great Twins (MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL). The Twins were regarded as minor gods and were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra, meaning respectively 'The One who has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. Both names can be understood as titles of Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], Gemini was associated with the myth of [[Castor and Pollux]], the children of [[Leda]] and [[Argonauts]] both. Pollux was the son of [[Zeus]], who seduced Leda, while Castor was the son of [[Tyndareus]], king of Sparta and Leda's husband. Castor and Pollux were also mythologically associated with [[St. Elmo's fire]] in their role as the protectors of sailors.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=150-152}} When Castor died, because he was mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, and he did, by uniting them together in the heavens.

==Visualizations==
[[File:Gemini constellation map visualization 1.PNG|thumb|280px|left|Diagram of [[H.A. Rey]]'s alternative way to connect the stars of the constellation Gemini. Twins are shown holding hands.]]

Gemini is dominated by [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], two bright stars that appear relatively very closely together forming an o shape, encouraging the mythological link between the constellation and twinship. The twin above and to the right (as seem from the Northern Hemisphere) is Castor, whose brightest star is [[α Geminorum|α Gem]]; it is a second magnitude star and represents Castor's head. The twin below and to the left is Pollux, whose brightest star is [[β Geminorum|β Gem]] (more commonly called Pollux); it is of the first magnitude and represents Pollux's head. Furthermore, the other stars can be visualized as two parallel lines descending from the two main stars, making it look like two figures.

[[H.A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative to the traditional visualization that connected the stars of Gemini to show twins holding hands. Pollux's torso is represented by the star [[Upsilon Geminorum|υ Gem]], Pollux's right hand by [[Iota Geminorum|ι Gem]], Pollux's left hand by [[Kappa Geminorum|κ Gem]]; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Pollux's pelvis is represented by the star [[Delta Geminorum|δ Gem]], Pollux's right knee by [[Zeta Geminorum|ζ Gem]], Pollux's right foot by [[Gamma Geminorum|γ Gem]], Pollux's left knee by [[Lambda Geminorum|λ Gem]], and Pollux's left foot by [[Xi Geminorum|ξ Gem]]. γ Gem is of the second magnitude, while δ and ξ Gem are of the third magnitude. Castor's torso is represented by the star [[Tau Geminorum|τ Gem]], Castor's left hand by [[Iota Geminorum|ι Gem]] (which he shares with Pollux), Castor's right hand by [[Theta Geminorum|θ Gem]]; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Castor's pelvis is represented by the star [[Epsilon Geminorum|ε Gem]], Castor's left foot by [[Nu Geminorum|ν Gem]], and Castor's right foot by [[Mu Geminorum|μ Gem]] and [[Eta Geminorum|η Gem]]; ε, μ, and η Gem are of the third magnitude. The brightest star in this constellation is Pollux.

==Gemini in the history of astronomy==
In [[Meteorologica]] (1 343b30) [[Aristotle]] mentions that he observed Jupiter in [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with and then [[occultation|occulting]] a star in Gemini. This is the earliest known observation of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning by Richard Hinckley Allen, Dover, 1963, page 229&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1990 suggests the star involved was 1 Geminorum and the event took place on 5 December 337 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Evidence for the Dating of Aristotle ''Meteorologica'' 1-3 |first=Sheldon M. |last=Cohen |first2=Paul |last2=Burke |journal=Classical Philology |volume=85 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=126–129 |doi= 10.1086/367188|jstor=269702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] on 13 March 1781 it was located near [[Eta Geminorum|η Gem]].&lt;ref&gt;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning by Richard Hinckley Allen, Dover, 1963, page 236&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 [[Clyde Tombaugh]] exposed a series of [[photographic plates]] centred on [[Delta Geminorum|δ Gem]] and discovered [[Pluto]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations by Michael E. Bakich, Cambridge University Press, 1995, page 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that correspond to Gemini are located in two areas: the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'') and the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').

==Astrology==
{{main|Gemini (astrology)}}

{{As of|2008}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Gemini from June 20 to July 20. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] from May 21 to June 22, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from June 16 to July 15.

'''Corona Borealis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|b|ɒr|i|ˈ|æ|l|ɨ|s}} is a small [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;northern crown&quot;, a name inspired by its shape; its main [[star]]s form a semicircular arc. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

The brightest star is the 2.2-magnitude [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]]. Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date; three of these are orange giants, while the fourth—[[Rho Coronae Borealis]]—is a solar twin, very like our own [[Sun]]. [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] located one billion light-years from our Solar System containing over 400 members, the brightest of which are [[apparent magnitude|16th magnitude]].

== Characteristics ==
Corona Borealis is a small constellation bordered by [[Bootes]] to the north and west, [[Serpens|Serpens Caput]] to the south, and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CrB'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|15|16.0}} and {{RA|16|25.1}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 39.71° and 25.54°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Corona Borealis, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#hyi | accessdate=12 October 2013 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering 179 square degrees, Corona Borealis ranks 73rd in area.

The seven stars that make up the constellation's figure are all 4th-magnitude stars, except for the constellation's brightest star, Alpha Coronae Borealis. This blue-white [[main-sequence star]], also called Alphekka and Gemma, is of magnitude 2.2, though it is an [[Algol]]-type [[eclipsing binary]]. It varies by 0.1 magnitudes with a period of 17.4 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} Alphekka is 75 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Alpha+CrB&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = Alpha Coronae Borealis—Eclipsing binary of Algol type (detached) |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other six stars are [[Theta Coronae Borealis|Theta]], [[Beta Coronae Borealis|Beta]], [[Gamma Coronae Borealis|Gamma]], [[Delta Coronae Borealis|Delta]], [[Epsilon Coronae Borealis|Epsilon]], and [[Iota Coronae Borealis]].

Corona Borealis is home to several [[binary star|binary]] and [[double star]]s. [[Beta Coronae Borealis]] or Nusakan is a [[spectroscopic binary]] system located around 114 light-years away. The two components are separated by 10 astronomical units and orbit each other every 10.5 years.&lt;ref name=kalerbeta&gt;[http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/nusakan.html Nusakan], ''Stars'', Jim Kaler.  Accessed on line October 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeta Coronae Borealis]] is a double star divisible in small telescopes. It has two blue-white components, 470 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0. Another double star is [[Nu Coronae Borealis]]; both components are 550 light-years from Earth but have different [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] and are assumed to be unrelated. The primary, [[Nu1 Coronae Borealis|Nu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Coronae Borealis]], is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 5.2; the secondary, [[Nu2 Coronae Borealis|Nu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Coronae Borealis]] is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.4. [[Sigma Coronae Borealis]], on the other hand, is a true [[binary star]]. Both components are yellow and orbit each other every 1000 years. The system, 71 light-years from Earth, has a primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.6. Sigma Coronae Borealis is divisible by small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} [[ADS 9731]] is a system composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.

Corona Borealis is home to two remarkable [[Variable star|variable]] stars. [[T Coronae Borealis]] is an exploding variable star also known as the Blaze Star.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a [[nuclear chain reaction]] and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis is one of a handful of stars called [[recurrent nova]]e, which include [[RS Ophiuchi]], [[T Pyxidis]], [[V1017 Sagitarii]], and [[U Scorpii]]. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its most recent outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a [[binary star]] with a red-hued giant primary and a small blue secondary; its period is approximately 8 months.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=70–71}} [[R Coronae Borealis]] is a yellow-hued variable [[supergiant]] star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. Though small dips in brightness occur sporadically, extreme decreases happened most recently in 1962, 1972, and 1977. Small carbon particles building up in the [[stellar atmosphere]] may be responsible.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}}

[[S Coronae Borealis]] is a [[Mira variable|Mira-type]] long period variable. [[RR Coronae Borealis]] is a [[stellar classification|M3-type]] [[semiregular variable star|semiregular]] [[variable star|variable]] [[star]]

The nearest star to Earth in the constellation is [[Gliese 611]], a binary system consisting of a yellow main-sequence star of spectral type G8V,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%402940202&amp;Name=LHS%20%203152&amp;submit=submit |title = LHS 3152—igh proper-motion Star  |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[red dwarf]] of spectral type M4.

Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date. [[Kappa Coronae Borealis]] is an orange subgiant of spectral type K0III-IV that has a dust debris disk and one confirmed and one possible planet. [[Omicron Coronae Borealis]] is another K-type clump giant with one confirmed planet., believed to be, like [[HD 100655|HD 100655 b]], one of the two least massive planets known around clump giants. [[Rho Coronae Borealis]] is a [[Solar twin]], [[yellow dwarf]] around 57 [[light-year]]s distant. It has a planet around the size and mass of Jupiter orbiting it every 40 days. [[HD 145457]] is an orange giant of spectral type K0III found to have one planet.

=== Deep sky objects ===
Corona Borealis contains no bright [[deep-sky object]]s. [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] containing over 400 members, the brightest of which are [[apparent magnitude|16th magnitude]]. The cluster is more than one billion light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} Another galaxy cluster in the constellation, RX J1532.9+3021, is located approximately 3.9 billion [[light year]]s from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/rxj1532/| title =RX J1532.9+3021: Extreme Power of Black Hole Revealed |publisher =Chandra X-ray Center|date=January 23, 2014| accessdate =27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the cluster's center is a large [[elliptical galaxy]] containing the [[supermassive black hole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra&quot;/&gt;

In November 2013 astronomers discovered the largest structure in the universe that was found within this constellation, the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]].

== History and mythology ==
In [[Greek mythology]], Corona Borealis was sometimes considered to represent a crown that was given by [[Dionysus]] to [[Ariadne]], the daughter of [[Minos]] of Crete. When she wore the crown to her wedding, where she married Dionysus, he placed her crown in the heavens to commemorate the wedding.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} In [[Welsh mythology]], it was called [[Caer Arianrhod]], &quot;the Castle of the Silver Circle&quot;, and was the heavenly abode of the Lady [[Arianrhod]] (Squire, 2000:154–155). In [[Arabic mythology]], the constellation was known as &quot;the bowl of the poor people&quot; from the Arabic name قصعة المساكين, since the stars form an unsymmetrical pattern with an indent in one side, similar to the bowl of the poor. The Arabs also called the constellation Alphecca (a name later given to [[Alpha Coronae Borealis|Alpha Corona Borealis]]), which means &quot;separated&quot; or &quot;broken up,&quot; a reference to the resemblance of the stars of Corona Borealis to a loose string of jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kunitzch and Tom Smart, ''A Short Guide to Modern Star Names and their Derivations'' (Harrassowitz, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equivalents ==
{{see also|Corona Borealis (Chinese astronomy)}}
In [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]], the constellation is called ''womera'' (&quot;the boomerang&quot;) due to the shape of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;p. 151, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TIatz2DGXQwC Star Lore: Myths, Legends, and Facts], William Tyler Olcott, New York, Dover Publication Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wailwun people of northwestern New South Wales saw Corona Borealis as ''mullion wollai'' &quot;eagle's nest&quot;, with Altair and Vega—each called ''mullion''—the pair of eagles accompanying it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridley1875&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridley|first=William|title=Kámilarói, and other Australian languages|publisher=T. Richards, government printer|location=Sydney, New South Wales|year=1875|edition=2nd|pages=141–42|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/RidleyWilliam-1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cheyenne]] nation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called the main stars of this constellation the &quot;Camp Circle&quot; as they arranged their camps in a semicircle. Native Americans also used stars to make designs in the ground at the Medicine Wheel in Bighorn National Forest, Wyoming, USA.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corona Borealis are located within the [[Heavenly Market enclosure]] (天市垣, ''Tiān Shì Yuán'')&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0606/ap060626.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 6 月 26 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polynesian people]]s often recognized Corona Borealis; it was likely called ''Te Hetu'' in the [[Tuamotus]], whose people called the constellation ''Na Kaua-ki-tokerau''. In [[Hawaii]], the constellation was likely called ''Kaua-mea''; it was called ''Rangawhenua'' in [[New Zealand]]. The figure of Corona Borealis was called ''Te Wale-o-Awitu'' in [[Pukapuka]]. Its name in [[Tonga]] was unsure; it was either called ''Ao-o-Uvea'' or ''Kau-kupenga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}

'''Leo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|oʊ}} is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], lying between [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] to the west and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the east. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[lion]], and to the [[ancient Greeks]] represented the [[Nemean Lion]] killed by the mythical Greek hero [[Heracles]] (known to the [[ancient Romans]] as [[Hercules]]) as one of his [[Twelve_Labours|twelve labors.]] Its symbol is [[Image:Leo.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode| ♌}}). One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. The lion's mane and shoulders also form an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as &quot;the Sickle,&quot; which to modern observers may resemble a backwards &quot;question mark.&quot;

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Leo}}
Leo contains many bright stars, many of which were individually identified by the ancients. There are four stars of first or second magnitude, with render this constellation especially prominent:
* [[Regulus]], designated [[Alpha Leonis (star)|Alpha Leonis]], is a blue-white [[main-sequence]] star of magnitude 1.34, 77.5 light-years from Earth. It is a [[double star]] divisible in binoculars, with a secondary of magnitude 7.7. Its traditional name (Regulus) means &quot;the little king&quot;. 
* [[Beta Leonis]], called Denebola, is at the opposite end of the constellation to Regulus. It is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.23, 36 light-years from Earth. The name Denebola means &quot;the lion's tail&quot;. 
* Algieba, [[Gamma Leonis]], is a [[binary star]] with a third optical component; the primary and secondary are divisible in small telescopes and the tertiary is visible in binoculars. The primary is a gold-yellow [[giant star]] of magnitude 2.61 and the secondary is similar but at magnitude 3.6; they have a period of 600 years and are 126 light-years from Earth. The unrelated tertiary, [[40 Leonis]], is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.8. Its traditional name, Algieba, means &quot;the forehead&quot;. 
* [[Delta Leonis]], called Zosma, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.58, 58 light-years from Earth. [[Epsilon Leonis]] is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 3.0, 251 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}}

* [[Zeta Leonis]], called Adhafera, is an optical triple star. The brightest and only star designated Zeta Leonis, is a [[white giant]] star of magnitude 3.65, 260 light-years from Earth. The second brightest, [[39 Leonis]], is widely spaced to the south and of magnitude 5.8. [[35 Leonis]] is to the north and of magnitude 6.0. 
* [[Iota Leonis]] is a [[binary star]] divisible in medium amateur telescopes; they are divisible in small amateur telescopes at their widest (2053-2063). To the unaided eye, Iota Leonis appears to be a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.0. The system, 79 light-years from Earth, has components of magnitude 4.1 and 6.7 with a period of 183. 
* [[Tau Leonis]] is a double star divisible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 621 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a star of magnitude 8. [[54 Leonis]] is a binary star 289 light-years from Earth, divisible in small telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is a blue-white star of magnitude 6.3.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}}

The other named stars in Leo are [[Mu Leonis]], Rasalas (an abbreviation of &quot;Al Ras al Asad al Shamaliyy,&quot; meaning &quot;The Lion's Head Toward the South&quot;); and [[Theta Leonis]], Chertan or Coxa (&quot;hip&quot;).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}} &lt;ref&gt;[[William Tyler Olcott]], Constellation of Words: Leo (available at http://www.constellationsofwords.com/Constellations/Leo.html, retrieved 11/20/13).&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo is also home to one bright [[variable star]], the [[red giant]] [[R Leonis]]. It is a [[Mira variable]] with a minimum magnitude of 10 and normal maximum magnitude of 6; it periodically brightens to magnitude 4.4. R Leonis, 330 light-years from Earth, has a period of 310 days and a diameter of 450 [[solar diameter]]s.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}}

The star [[Wolf 359]] (CN Leonis), one of the [[List of nearest stars|nearest stars]] to Earth at 7.8 [[light-year]]s away, is in Leo.  Wolf 359 is a [[red dwarf]] of magnitude 13.5; it periodically brightens by one magnitude or less because it is a [[flare star]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}} [[Gliese 436]], a faint star in Leo about 33 light years away from the Sun, is orbited by a transiting Neptune-mass [[extrasolar planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040831.wplanet20831a/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth|title=Astronomers discover smallest &quot;exoplanets&quot; yet | location=Toronto}} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carbon star]] CW Leo ([[IRC +10216]]) is the brightest star in the night sky at the infrared N-band (10 μm wavelength).

The star [[SDSS J102915+172927]] (Caffau's star) is a population II star in the [[galactic halo]] seen in Leo. It is about 13 billion years old, making it one of the oldest stars in the Galaxy. It has the lowest [[metallicity]] of any known star.

Modern astronomers, including [[Tycho Brahe]] in 1602, excised a group of stars that once made up the &quot;tuft&quot; of the lion's tail and used them to form the new constellation [[Coma Berenices]] (Berenice's hair), although there was precedent for that designation among the ancient Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref&gt;L. Phil Simpson (Springer 2012) Guidebook to the Constellations: Telescopic Sights, Tales, and Myths, p. 235 (ISBN 9781441969415).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Phot-33c-03-fullres.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Messier 66]]
Leo contains many bright [[galaxy|galaxies]];  [[Messier 65]], [[Messier 66]], [[Messier 95]], [[Messier 96]], [[Messier 105]], and [[NGC 3628]] are the most famous, the first two being part of the [[Leo Triplet]].

The [[Leo Ring]], a cloud of hydrogen and helium gas, is found in orbit of two galaxies found within this constellation.

M66 is a spiral galaxy that is part of the Leo Triplet, whose other two members are M65 and NGC 3628. It is at a distance of 37 million light-years and has a somewhat distorted shape due to gravitational interactions with the other members of the Triplet, which are pulling stars away from M66. Eventually, the outermost stars may form a dwarf galaxy orbiting M66.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1 = Wilkins |first1 = Jamie |last2 = Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |location = Buffalo, New York |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both M65 and M66 are visible in large binoculars or small telescopes, but their concentrated nuclei and elongation are only visible in large amateur instruments.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}}

M95 and M96 are both [[spiral galaxies]] 20 million light-years from Earth. Though they are visible as fuzzy objects in small telescopes, their structure is only visible in larger instruments. M95 is a [[barred spiral galaxy]]. M105 is about a degree away from the M95/M96 pair; it is an [[elliptical galaxy]] of the 9th magnitude, also about 20 million light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-168}}

[[NGC 2903]] is a [[barred spiral galaxy]] discovered by [[William Herschel]] in 1784. It is very similar in size and shape to the Milky Way and is located 25 million light-years from Earth. In its core, NGC 2903 has many &quot;hotspots&quot;, which have been found to be near regions of [[star formation]]. The star formation in this region is thought to be due to the presence of the dusty bar, which sends shock waves through its rotation to an area with a diameter of 2,000 light-years. The outskirts of the galaxy have many young [[open cluster]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

Leo is also home to some of the largest structures in the observable universe. Some of the structures found in the constellation are the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], [[U1.11]], [[U1.54]], and the [[Huge-LQG]], which are all [[large quasar group]]s; the latter being the second largest structure known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 11 January 2013|last=Prostak|first=Sergio|title=Universe’s Largest Structure Discovered|url=http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/article00818.html|publisher=scinews.com|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]]).

===Meteor showers===
The [[Leonids]] occur in November, peaking on November 14–15, and have a [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] close to [[Gamma Leonis]]. Its parent body is [[Comet Tempel-Tuttle]], which causes significant outbursts every 35 years. The normal peak rate is approximately 10 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-167}}

The [[January Leonids]] are a minor shower that peaks between January 1 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2011 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mythology==
Leo was one of the earliest recognized constellations, with archaeological evidence that the Mesopotamians had a similar constellation as early as 4000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;/&gt; The Persians called Leo ''Ser'' or ''Shir''; the Turks, ''Artan''; the Syrians, ''Aryo''; the Jews, ''Arye''; the Indians, ''Simha'', all meaning &quot;lion&quot;. 
[[File:Hercules and Nemean Lion Stamp.jpg|275px|thumbnail|Greek stamp depicting a mosaical image of the encounter between Hercules and Leo,the Nemean Lion.]]
Some mythologists believe that in Sumeria, Leo represented the monster [[Khumbaba]], who was killed by [[Gilgamesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Tamra Andrews (Oxford University Press 2000) Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky (ISBN 9780195136777).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was called UR.GU.LA, the &quot;Great Lion&quot;; the bright star [[Regulus]] was known as &quot;the star that stands at the Lion's breast.&quot;  Regulus also had distinctly regal associations, as it was known as the King Star.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008 page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], Leo was identified as the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]] which was killed by [[Heracles]] (Hercules to the Romans) during the first of his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Stars and Planets |last = Pasachoff |first = Jay M. |location = Boston, Massachusetts |publisher = Houghton Mifflin |year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-167}}  The Nemean Lion would take women as hostages to its lair in a cave, luring warriors from nearby towns to save the damsel in distress, to their misfortune.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite book|title=Mythology: Myths, Legends and Fantasies|year=2007|publisher=Struik|isbn=9781770074538|pages=121-122|editor=Janet Parker, et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lion was impervious to any weaponry; thus, the warriors' clubs, swords, and spears were rendered useless against it.  Realizing that he must defeat the Lion with his bare hands, Hercules slipped into the Lion's cave and engaged it at close quarters.&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt;   When the Lion pounced, Hercules caught it in midair, one hand grasping the Lion's forelegs and the other its hind legs, and bent it backwards, breaking its back and freeing the trapped maidens.&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt;   Zeus commemorated this labor by placing the Lion in the sky.&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt; 

The Roman poet [[Ovid]] called it ''Herculeus Leo'' and ''Violentus Leo''. ''Bacchi Sidus'' (star of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]) was another of its titles, the god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] always being identified with this animal. However, [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] called it ''Jovis et Junonis Sidus'' (Star of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]).

Early Hindu astronomers knew it as ''Ashlesha''(nakshtra-sub constellation) and as ''Simha'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''Simham''.

==Astrology==
{{Main|Leo (astrology)}}
{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Leo from August 10 to Sept 10. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] from July 23 to August 23, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from August 16 to September 17.

Leo is commonly represented as if the sickle-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of stars is the back of the Lion's head. The sickle is marked by six stars: [[Epsilon Leonis]], [[Mu Leonis]], [[Zeta Leonis]], [[Gamma Leonis]], [[Eta Leonis]], and [[Regulus|Alpha Leonis]]. The lion's tail is marked by [[Beta Leonis]] (Denebola) and the rest of his body is delineated by [[Delta Leonis]] and [[Theta Leonis]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=166-167}}

[[Image:Leo constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of [[H.A. Rey]]'s alternative way to connect the stars of the constellation Leo.  The lion is shown walking.]]
[[H.A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars, which graphically shows a [[lion]] walking. The stars [[delta Leonis]], [[gamma Leonis]], [[eta Leonis]], and [[theta Leonis]] form the body of the lion, with gamma Leonis being of the second magnitude and delta Leonis and theta Leonis being of the third magnitude. The stars gamma Leonis, [[zeta Leonis]], [[mu Leonis]], [[epsilon Leonis]], and [[eta Leonis]] form the lion's [[neck]], with epsilon Leonis being of the third magnitude. The stars mu Leonis, [[kappa Leonis]], [[lambda Leonis]], and epsilon Leonis form the [[head]] of the lion. Delta Leonis and [[beta Leonis]] form the lion's [[tail]]: beta Leonis, also known as [[Denebola]], is the bright tip of the tail with a magnitude of two. The stars [[theta Leonis]], [[iota Leonis]], and [[sigma Leonis]] form the left hind [[leg]] of the lion, with sigma Leonis being the foot.  The stars theta Leonis and [[rho Leonis]] form the right hind leg, with rho Leonis being the foot. The stars [[eta Leonis]] and [[alpha Leonis]] mark the lion's heart, with alpha Leonis, also known as [[Regulus]], being the bright star of magnitude one.  The stars eta Leonis and [[omicron Leonis]] form the right front foot of the Lion.&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Rey, ''The Stars &amp;mdash; A New Way To See Them''.  Enlarged World-Wide Edition.

'''Delphinus''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɛ|l|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, close to the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dolphin]]. Delphinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains among the 88 modern constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size.

Delphinus' brightest stars form a distinctive [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that can easily be recognized. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by [[Vulpecula]] the fox, [[Sagitta]] the arrow, [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] the eagle, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the water-carrier, [[Equuleus]] the foal and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] the flying horse.

==Notable features==
[[Image:DelphinusCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Delphinus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
Delphinus does not have any bright stars; its brightest star is of magnitude 3.8. The main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in Delphinus is [[Job's Coffin]], formed from the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Alpha and Beta Delphini are named Sualocin and Rotanev, respectively. When read backwards, they read as Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of [[Palermo Astronomical Observatory|Palermo Observatory]]'s former director, [[Niccolò Cacciatore]]. However, Delphinus is in a rich Milky Way star field.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}}

[[Alpha Delphini]], called Sualocin, is a blue-white hued [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 3.8, 241 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Delphini]], called Rotanev, is a close [[binary star]] and the brightest in Delphinus, divisible in only large amateur telescopes. To the unaided eye, it appears to be a white star of magnitude 3.6. It has a period of 27 years and is 97 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Delphini]] is a celebrated binary star among amateur astronomers. The primary is a gold-colored star of magnitude 4.3 and the secondary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 5.1. 102 light-years away, the components of Gamma Delphini are divisible in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}} The secondary, also described as green, is 10 arcseconds from the primary. [[Struve 2725]], called the &quot;Ghost Double&quot;, is a pair that appears similar to a dimmer Gamma Delphini. Its components of magnitudes 7.6 and 8.4 are separated by 6 arcseconds and are 15 arcminutes from Gamma Delphini itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;/&gt;

There are several dimmer stars in Delphinus. [[Delta Delphini]] is a type A7&amp;nbsp;IIIp star of magnitude 4.43. [[Epsilon Delphini]], called Deneb Dulfim, meaning &quot;tail of the Dolphin&quot;, is a star of [[spectral class]] B6&amp;nbsp;III and magnitude 4.

Delphinus is also home to several variable stars. [[R Delphini]] is a [[Mira variable|Mira-type variable star]] with a period of 285.5 days. Its magnitude ranges between a maximum of 7.6 and a minimum of 13.8.

[[Rho Aquilae]] moved across the border into Delphinus in 1992.

On 14 August 2013, a possible [[nova]] was discovered by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]] Koichi Itagaki, initially labelled PNV J20233073+2046041, now labelled Nova Delphini 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Deep-sky objects===
Because it is in a rich [[Milky Way]] star field, Delphinus has several deep-sky objects. [[NGC 6891]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of magnitude 10.5. [[NGC 6934]] is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 9.75. At a distance of about 185,000 light-years, the globular cluster [[NGC 7006]] is extremely remote. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5.

¡==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Delphinus, Sagitta, Aquila, and Antinous.jpg|left|thumb|Delphinus is depicted on the left of this card from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Delphinus is associated with two stories from [[Greek mythology]].

According to the first Greek god [[Poseidon]] wanted to marry [[Amphitrite]], a beautiful [[nereid]]. She, however, wanting to protect her virginity, fled to the Atlas mountains. Her suitor then sent out several searchers, among them a certain Delphinus. Delphinus accidentally stumbled upon her and was able to persuade Amphitrite to accept Poseidon's wooing. Out of gratitude the god placed the image of a dolphin among the stars.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The second story tells of the Greek poet [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] (7th century BC), who was saved by a dolphin.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}} He was a court musician at the palace of Periander, ruler of Corinth. Arion had amassed a fortune during his travels to Sicily and Italy. On his way home from [[Taranto|Tarentum]] his wealth caused the crew of his ship to conspire against him. Threatened with death, Arion asked to be granted a last wish which the crew granted: he wanted to sing a dirge.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' I.23-24;&lt;br&gt;''also'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' XVI.19; [[Plutarch]], ''Conv. sept. sap.'' 160-62; [[Shakespeare]], ''Twelfth Night'' (Act I, Sc 2, line 16)&lt;/ref&gt; This he did, and while doing so, flung himself into the sea.  There, he was rescued by a dolphin which had been charmed by Arion's music. The dolphin carried Arion to the coast of Greece and left.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Celestial Dolphin |last = Schaaf |first = Fred |page = 47 |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Delphinus are located within ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|the Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}  [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060704.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 4 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Polynesia]], two cultures recognized Delphinus as a constellation. On [[Pukapuka]], it was called ''Te Toloa'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Te Uru-o-tiki''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=283}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Delphinus (AF-24)]] and [[USS Delphinus (PHM-1)]], two [[United States]] Navy ships, are named after the constellation.

'''Auriga''' is one of the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and remains one of the [[List of constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Located north of the [[celestial equator]], its name is the [[Latin]] word for &quot;[[chariot]]eer&quot;, associating it with various mythological charioteers, including [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] and [[Myrtilus]]. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], along with the five other constellations that have stars in the [[Winter Hexagon]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. Because of its northern [[declination]], Auriga is only visible as far as 34° south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest constellation, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].

Its brightest star, [[Capella (star)|Capella]], is an unusual [[multiple star system]] among the brightest stars in the night sky. [[Beta Aurigae]] is an interesting [[variable star]] in the constellation; [[Epsilon Aurigae]], a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter [[Milky Way]], Auriga has many bright [[open cluster]]s in its borders, including [[Messier 36|M36]], [[Messier 37|M37]], and [[Messier 38|M38]], popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent [[nebula]], the [[Flaming Star Nebula]], associated with the variable star [[AE Aurigae]].

In Chinese mythology, Auriga's stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, made up of the modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] for the [[Aurigids]], [[Zeta Aurigids]], [[Delta Aurigids]], and the hypothesized [[Iota Aurigids]].

== History and mythology ==

The first record of Auriga's stars was in [[Mesopotamia]] as a constellation called GAM, representing a [[scimitar]] or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the [[MUL.APIN]]. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for [[Beta Tauri|Elnath]], traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, [[Bedouin]] astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mesopotamian Traditions''|1998}} The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mediterranean Traditions''|1998}}

In [[Greek mythology]], Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero [[Erichthonius of Athens]], the [[chthonic]] son of [[Hephaestus]] who was raised by the goddess [[Athena]]. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the [[quadriga]], the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper [[Amphictyon]], the event that made Erichthonius the king of [[Athens]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} His chariot was created in the image of the Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}} The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.{{sfn|Krupp|2007}}

Auriga, however, is sometimes described as [[Myrtilus]], who was [[Hermes]]'s son and the charioteer of [[Oenomaus]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter [[Hippodamia]]. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, [[Pelops]], killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is [[Theseus]]'s son [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by [[Asclepius]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=79}} Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, it is likely that the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.{{sfn|Winterburn|2009|p=131}}

An incidental appearance of Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of [[Medea]]'s brother. In the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=109}}

[[Capella (star)|Capella]] is associated with the mythological she-goat [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], who breast-fed the infant Zeus. It forms an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] with the stars [[Epsilon Aurigae]], [[Zeta Aurigae]], and [[Eta Aurigae]], the latter two of which are known as the ''[[Haedi]]'' (the [[Goat|Kids]]).{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a [[nymph]]. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]' defeat, because Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his [[aegis]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}} The asterism containing the three goats had been a separate constellation; however, [[Ptolemy]] merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century [[Almagest]].{{sfn|Winterburn|2009|p=131}} Before that, Capella was sometimes seen as its own constellation—by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]]—called ''Capra'', ''Caper'', or ''Hircus'', all of which relate to its status as the &quot;goat star&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=83–91}} Zeta Aurigae and Eta Aurigae were first called the &quot;Kids&quot; by [[Cleostratus]], an ancient Greek astronomer.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Auriga.jpg|thumb|left|Auriga carrying the goat and kids as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards illustrated by Sidney Hall, London ''circa'' 1825.]]

Traditionally, illustrations of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat over his left shoulder and has two [[Goat#Reproduction|kids]] under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot in his right hand.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}} However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas ''[[Hyginus]]'' deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. [[Jacob Micyllus]] depicted Auriga in his ''Hyginus'' of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a [[mule]], called ''Mulus clitellatus'' by [[Johann Bayer]].{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=83–91}} One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as [[Adam]] kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=65–69}}

Occasionally, Auriga is seen not as the Charioteer but as [[Bellerophon]], the mortal rider of [[Pegasus]] who dared to approach [[Mount Olympus]]. In this version of the tale, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] pitied Bellerophon for his foolishness and placed him in the stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=29}}

Some of the stars of Auriga were incorporated into a [[former constellations|now-defunct constellation]] called [[Telescopium Herschelii]]. This constellation was introduced by [[Maximilian Hell]] to honor [[William Herschel]]'s discovery of [[Uranus]]. Originally, it included two constellations, Tubus Hershelii Major ''{{sic}}'', in [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]], and Auriga, and Tubus Hershelii Minor ''{{sic}}'' in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]; both represented Herschel's telescopes. [[Johann Bode]] combined Hell's constellations into Telescopium Herschelii in 1801, located mostly in Auriga.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Telescopium Herschelii}}

Since the time of Ptolemy, Auriga has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]], although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006|pp=128–129}} In 1922, the IAU designated its recommended three-letter abbreviation, &quot;Aur&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|1922|pp=469–471}} The official boundaries of Auriga were created in 1930 by [[Eugène Delporte]] as a polygon of 21 segments. Its [[right ascension]] is between 4&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 37.5&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and 7&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 30.5&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[declination]] is between 27.9° and 56.2° in the [[equatorial coordinate system]].{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Auriga}}

=== In non-Western astronomy ===

{{see also|Auriga (Chinese astronomy)}}

The stars of Auriga were incorporated into several Chinese constellations. ''Wuche'', the five chariots of the celestial emperors and the representation of the grain harvest, was a constellation formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. ''Sanzhu'' or ''Zhu'' was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. ''Xianchi'', the pond where the sun set and ''Tianhuang'', a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. ''Zuoqi'', representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. ''Bagu'', a constellation mostly formed from stars in [[Camelopardalis]] representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}

In ancient [[Hindu astronomy]], Capella represented the heart of [[Brahma]] and was important religiously. Ancient Peruvian peoples saw Capella, called ''Colca'', as a star intimately connected to the affairs of shepherds.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=65–69}}

In Brazil, the [[Bororo people]] incorporate the stars of Auriga into a massive constellation representing a [[caiman]]; its southern stars represent the end of the animal's tail. The eastern portion of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] is the rest of the tail, while [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is its body and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=70}} There is evidence that Capella was significant to the [[Aztec people]], as the [[Mesoamerica#Late Classic|Late Classic]] site [[Monte Albán]] has a marker for the star's [[heliacal rising]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=225}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] of [[California]] and [[Nevada]] also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped [[petroglyph]]s.{{sfn|Aveni|1977|p=193}} The indigenous [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.{{sfn|Buckstaff|1927|p=280}}

The people of the [[Marshall Islands]] featured Auriga in the myth of [[Dümur]], which tells the story of the creation of the sky. [[Antares]] in [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] represents Dümur, the oldest son of the stars' mother, and the [[Pleiades]] represent her youngest son. The mother of the stars, [[Ligedaner]],{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=221–222}}{{sfn|Goodenough|1953|p=43}} is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of [[Alinablab]]. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked Dümur to let her come in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=221–222}} Elsewhere in the central [[Caroline Islands]], Capella was called ''Jefegen uun'' (variations include ''efang alul'', ''evang-el-ul'', and ''iefangel uul''), meaning &quot;north of Aldebaran&quot;.{{sfn|Goodenough|1953|pp=26,43}} Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies. On [[Pukapuka]], the figure of modern Auriga was called ''Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo'' (&quot;The house of Tutakaiolo&quot;);{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=268}} in the [[Society Islands]], it was called ''Faa-nui'' (&quot;Great Valley&quot;).{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=202}} Capella itself was called ''Tahi-anii'' (&quot;Unique Sovereign&quot;) in the Societies.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=252}} ''Hoku-lei'' was the name for Capella but may have been the name for the whole constellation; the name means &quot;Star-wreath&quot; and refers to one of the wives of the Pleiades, called ''Makalii''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=210}}

The stars of Auriga feature in [[Inuit]] constellations. [[Quturjuuk]], meaning &quot;collar-bones&quot;,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=65}} was a constellation that included Capella (Alpha Aurigae), Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (Beta Geminorum), and [[Castor (star)|Castor]] (Alpha Geminorum). Its rising signalled that the constellation [[Aagjuuk]], made up of [[Altair]] (Alpha Aquilae), [[Tarazed]] (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes [[Alshain]] (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon. Aagjuuk, which represented the dawn following the winter solstice, was an incredibly important constellation in the Inuit mythos.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=44–51}} It was also used for navigation and time-keeping at night.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=66}}

==== Bright stars ====
[[Capella (star)|Alpha Aurigae]] (Capella), the brightest star in Auriga, is a [[G-type star|G8III class star]] (G-type [[giant star|giant]]) 43 [[light-year]]s away{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Aurigae}} and the sixth brightest star in the night sky at magnitude 0.08.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} Its traditional name is a reference to its mythological position as Amalthea; it is sometimes called the &quot;Goat Star&quot;.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}}{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Capella's names all point to this mythology. In Arabic, Capella was called ''al-'Ayyuq'', meaning &quot;the goat&quot;, and in Sumerian, it was called mul.ÁŠ.KAR, &quot;the goat star&quot;.{{sfn|Davis|1944}} On [[Ontong Java]], Capella was called ''ngahalapolu''.{{sfn|Goodenough|1953|pp=13–14}} Capella is a [[spectroscopic binary]] with a period of 104 days; the components are both [[yellow giant]]s,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} more specifically, the primary is a G-type star and the secondary is between a G-type and F-type star in its evolution.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} The secondary is formally classified as a G0III class star (G-type giant).{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Aurigae}} The primary has a radius of 11.87 [[solar radii]] (R&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;) and a mass of 2.47 [[solar mass]]es (M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;); the secondary has a radius of 8.75 R&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and a mass of 2.44 M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. The two components are separated by 110 million kilometers, almost 75% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun.{{sfn|Torres|Claret|Young|2009|p=1365}} The star's status as a binary was discovered in 1899 at the [[Lick Observatory]]; its period was determined in 1919 by [[J.A. Anderson]] at the 100-inch [[Mt. Wilson Observatory]] telescope. It appears with a golden-yellow hue, though Ptolemy and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] both described its color as red, a phenomenon attributed not to a change in Capella's color but to the idiosyncrasies of their color sensitivities.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Capella has an [[absolute magnitude]] of 0.3 and a [[luminosity]] of 160 times the [[solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]], or 160 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; (the primary is 90 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and the secondary is 70 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;).{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} It may be loosely associated with the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], an [[open cluster]] in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], because of their similar [[proper motion]]. Capella has one more companion, Capella H, which is a pair of [[red dwarf]] stars located 11,000 [[astronomical unit]]s (0.17 [[light-year]]s) from the main pair.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

[[Beta Aurigae]] (Menkalinan, Menkarlina){{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} is a bright [[A-type star|A2IV class star]] (A-type [[subgiant]]).{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Aurigae}} Its Arabic name comes from the phrase ''mankib dhu al-'inan'', meaning &quot;shoulder of the charioteer&quot; and is a reference to Beta Aurigae's location in the constellation.{{sfn|Davis|1944}} Menkalinan is 81 light-years away{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Aurigae}} and has a magnitude of 1.90. Like Epsilon Aurigae, it is an [[eclipsing binary]] star that varies in magnitude by 0.1&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. The two components are blue-white stars that have a period of 3.96 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} Its double nature was revealed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] in 1890 by [[Antonia Maury]],{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} making it the second spectroscopic binary discovered,{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=279}} and its variable nature was discovered [[photometry (astronomy)|photometrically]] 20 years later by [[Joel Stebbins]].{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Menkalinan has an absolute magnitude of 0.6 and a luminosity of 50 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} The component of its motion in the direction of Earth is {{convert|18|km|mi}} per second. Beta Aurigae may be associated with a stream of abount 70 stars including [[Delta Leonis]] and [[Alpha Ophiuchi]]; the [[proper motion]] of this group is comparable to that of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], though the connection is only hypothesized. Besides its close eclipsing companion, Menkalinan has two other stars associated with it. One is an unrelated [[optical binary|optical companion]], discovered in 1783 by [[William Herschel]]; it has a magnitude of 10.5 and has a separation of 184 [[arcsecond]]s. The other is likely associated gravitationally with the primary, as determined by their common proper motion. This 14th magnitude star was discovered in 1901 by [[Edward Emerson Barnard]]. It has a separation of 12.6 arcseconds, and is around 350 astronomical units from the primary.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

==== Other bright stars ====

Besides the particularly bright stars of Alpha and Beta Aurigae, the constellation has many dimmer stars. [[Beta Tauri|Gamma Aurigae]], now Beta Tauri (El Nath, Alnath) is a [[B-type star|B7III class star]] (B-type [[giant star|giant]]).{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Tauri}} It was originally considered to be a part of both Auriga and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], but is now classified only as Beta Tauri.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} [[Iota Aurigae]], also called Hasseleh and Kabdhilinan, is a [[K-type star|K3II class star]] (K-type [[bright giant]]){{sfn|SIMBAD Iota Aurigae}} of magnitude 2.69;{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} it is 494 light-years away from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Iota Aurigae}} It evolved from a B-type star to a K-type star over the estimated 30–45 million years since its birth.{{sfn|Kaler|2009}} Iota Aurigae has an absolute magnitude of −2.3 and a luminosity of 700 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} It is classed as a particularly luminous [[bright giant]], but appears dimmer than it should because dust clouds in the Milky Way block some of its light; astronomers estimate that it appears 0.6 magnitudes fainter.{{sfn|Kaler|2009}} It is also a [[hybrid star]], an [[x-ray]] producing giant star that emits x-rays from its [[corona]] and has a cool [[stellar wind]].{{sfn|Kaler|2009}}{{sfn|Kashyap|Rosner|Harnden|Maggio|1994}} Though its proper motion is just 0.02 arcseconds per year, it has a radial velocity of {{convert|10.5|mi|km}} per second in recession.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The traditional name Kabdhilinan, sometimes shortened to &quot;Alkab&quot;, comes from the Arabic phrase ''al-kab dh'il inan'', meaning &quot;shoulder of the rein holder&quot;. Iota Aurigae may end as a [[supernova]], but because it is close to the mass limit for such stars, it may instead become a [[white dwarf]].{{sfn|Kaler|2009}}

[[Delta Aurigae]], the northernmost bright star in Auriga,{{sfn|Kaler|2008}} is a K0III-type star (K-type giant),{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}}{{sfn|Kaler|2008}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Aurigae}} 126 light-years from Earth{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Aurigae}} and approximately 1.3 billion years old.{{sfn|Kaler|2008}} It has a magnitude of 3.72, an absolute magnitude of 0.2, and a luminosity of 60 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} About 12 times the radius of the Sun, Delta Aurigae weighs only two solar masses and rotates with a period of almost one year.{{sfn|Kaler|2008}} Though it is often listed as a single star,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340}} it actually has three very widely spaced optical companions. One is a double star of magnitude 11, two arcminutes from Delta, and the other is a star of magnitude 10, three arcminutes from Delta.{{sfn|Kaler|2008}}

[[Lambda Aurigae]] (Al Hurr){{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}} is a G1.5IV-V-type star (G-type star intermediate between a subgiant and [[main-sequence star]]){{sfn|SIMBAD Lambda Aurigae}} of magnitude 4.71. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.4{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} and is located 41 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Lambda Aurigae}} It has very weak emissions in the [[infrared]] spectrum, like Epsilon Aurigae.{{sfn|Hopkins|Stencel|2007}} In [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations of Epsilon, an unusual variable, Lambda Aurigae is commonly used as a comparison star.{{sfn|Hopkins|Stencel|2006}}{{sfn|Lucas|Hopkins|Stencel|2006}} It is reaching the end of its [[hydrogen fusion|hydrogen-fusing]] [[stellar evolution|lifespan]] at an age of 6.2 billion years. It also has an unusually high [[radial velocity]] at 83&amp;nbsp;km/second. Though older than the Sun, it is similar in many ways; its mass is 1.07 solar masses, a radius of 1.3 solar radii, and a rotational period of 26 days. However, it differs from the Sun in its [[metallicity]]; its [[iron]] content is 1.15 times that of the Sun and it has relatively less [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]]. Like Delta, it has several optical companions and is often categorized as a single star. The brightest companions are of magnitude 10, separated by 175 and 203 arcseconds. The dimmer companions are of magnitude 13 and 14, 87 and 310 arcseconds from Lambda, respectively.{{sfn|Kaler|2011}} [[Nu Aurigae]] is a G9.5III (G-type giant){{sfn|SIMBAD Nu Aurigae}} star of magnitude 3.97,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} 230 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Nu Aurigae}} It has a luminosity of 60L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and an absolute magnitude of 0.2.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} Nu Aurigae is a giant star with a radius of 20–21 solar radii and a mass of approximately 3 solar masses. It may technically be a binary star; its companion, sometimes listed as optical and separated by 56 arcseconds, is a dwarf star of spectral type K6 and magnitude 11.4. Its period is more than 120,000 years and it orbits at least 3700 AU from the primary.{{sfn|Kaler|2008}}

The most prominent variable star in Auriga is [[Epsilon Aurigae]] (Al Maz, Almaaz),{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} an [[F-type star|F0 class]] [[eclipsing binary star]]{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} with an unusually long period of 27 years; its last minima occurred from 1982–1984 and 2009–2011.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} The distance to the system is disputed, variously cited as 4600{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} and 2170 light-years.{{sfn|SIMBAD Epsilon Aurigae}} The primary is a [[white supergiant]], and the secondary may be itself a binary star within a large dusty disk. Its maximum magnitude is 3.0, but it stays at a minimum magnitude of 3.8 for around a year; its most recent eclipse began in 2009.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} The primary has an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and an unusually high luminosity of 200,000 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;, the reason it appears so bright at such a great distance.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} Epsilon Aurigae is the longest-period eclipsing binary currently known.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} The first observed eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae occurred in 1821, though its variable status was not confirmed until the eclipse of 1847–1848. From that time forward, many theories were put forth as to the nature of the eclipsing component. Epsilon Aurigae has a noneclipsing component, which is visible as a 14th magnitude companion separated from the primary by 28.6 arcseconds. It was discovered by [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] in 1891 at the [[Dearborn Observatory]], and is about 0.5 light-years from the primary.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

Another eclipsing binary in Auriga, part of the ''Haedi'' asterism with Epsilon Aurigae, is [[Zeta Aurigae]] (Sadatoni),{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} an eclipsing binary star at a distance of 776{{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Aurigae}} light-years with a period of 2 years and 8 months.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} It has an absolute magnitude of −2.3.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} The primary is an orange-hued{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} K5II-type star (K-type bright giant){{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Aurigae}} and the secondary is a smaller blue star similar to [[Regulus]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} its period is 972 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} The secondary is a B7V-type star, a B-type main-sequence star.{{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Aurigae}} Zeta Aurigae's maximum magnitude is 3.7 and its minimum magnitude is 4.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} The full eclipse of the small blue star by the orange giant lasts 38 days, with two partial phases of 32 days at the beginning and end.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The primary has a diameter of 150 [[solar diameter|D&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] and a [[luminosity]] of 700 [[solar luminosity|L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]]; the secondary has a diameter of 4 D&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and a luminosity of 140 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} Zeta Aurigae was spectroscopically determined to be a double star by Antonia Maury in 1897 and was confirmed as a binary star in 1908 by [[William Wallace Campbell]]. The two stars orbit each other about {{convert|500000000|mi|km}} apart. Zeta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of {{convert|8|mi|km}} per second.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The last star in the asterism is [[Eta Aurigae]], a [[B-type star|B3 class star]] located 243 light-years from Earth{{sfn|SIMBAD Eta Aurigae}} with a magnitude of 3.17.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} It is a B3V class star, meaning that it is a blue-white hued main-sequence star.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}{{sfn|SIMBAD Eta Aurigae}} Eta Aurigae is a part of the ''Haedi'' or &quot;Kids&quot; asterism, along with Zeta and Epsilon Aurigae. Eta Aurigae has an absolute magnitude of −1.7 and a luminosity of 450 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} Eta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} per second.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

[[T Aurigae]] (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova discovered at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by [[Thomas David Anderson]]. It became visible to the naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a [[slow nova]], similar to [[DQ Herculis]]. Like DQ Herculis, [[WZ Sagittae]], [[Nova Persei 1901]] and [[Nova Aquilae 1918]], it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

==== Other variable stars ====

There are many other variable stars of different types in Auriga. [[Psi1 Aurigae|ψ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Aurigae]] (Dolones){{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} is an orange-hued [[supergiant]], which ranges between magnitudes 4.8 and 5.7, though not with a regular period.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} It has a spectral class of K5Iab,{{sfn|SIMBAD Psi1 Aurigae}} an average magnitude of 4.91, and an absolute magnitude of −5.7.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} Dolones is 3976 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Psi1 Aurigae}} [[RT Aurigae]] is a [[Cepheid variable]] which ranges between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.8 over a period of 3.7 days. A yellow-white supergiant, it lies at a distance of 1600 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} It was discovered to be variable by English amateur T.H. Astbury in 1905.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} It has a spectral class of F81bv, meaning that it is an F-type supergiant star.{{sfn|SIMBAD RT Aurigae}} [[RX Aurigae]] is a Cepheid variable as well; it varies in magnitude from a minimum of 8.0 to a maximum of 7.3;{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} its spectral class is G0Iabv.{{sfn|SIMBAD RX Aurigae}} It has a period of 11.62 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} [[RW Aurigae]] is the prototype of its class of irregular variable stars. Its variability was discovered in 1906 by [[Lydia Ceraski]] at the [[Moscow Observatory]]. RW Aurigae's spectrum indicates a turbulent [[stellar atmosphere]], and has prominent [[emission line]]s of [[calcium]] and [[hydrogen]].{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Its spectral type is G5V:e.{{sfn|SIMBAD RW Aurigae}} [[SS Aurigae]] is an [[SS Cygni]]-type variable star, classified as an explosive dwarf. Discovered by [[Emil Silbernagel]] in 1907, it is almost always at its minimum magnitude of 15, but brightens to a maximum up to 60 times brighter than the minimum an average of every 55 days, though the period can range from 50 days to more than 100 days. It takes about 24 hours for the star to go from its minimum to maximum magnitude. SS Aurigae is a very close binary star with a period of 4 hours and 20 minutes. Both components are small subdwarf stars; there has been dispute in the scientific community about which star originates the outbursts.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} [[UU Aurigae]] is a variable [[red giant]] star at a distance of 2,000 light-years. It has a period of approximately 234 days and ranges between magnitudes 5.0 and 7.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}}

[[File:FlamingStarHunterWilson.jpg|thumb|The Flaming Star Nebula (IC 405), and its neighbor IC 410, along with AE Aurigae, which illuminates the nebula.]]

[[AE Aurigae]] is a blue-hued main-sequence variable star. It is normally of magnitude 6.0, but its magnitude varies irregularly. AE Aurigae is associated with the 9-light-year-wide [[Flaming Star Nebula]] (IC 405), which it illuminates. However, AE Aurigae likely entered the nebula only recently, as determined through the discrepancy between the radial velocities of the star and the nebula, {{convert|36|mi|km}} per second and {{convert|13|mi|km}} per second, respectively. It has been hypothesized that AE Aurigae is a &quot;[[runaway star]]&quot; from the young cluster in the [[Orion Nebula]], leaving the cluster approximately 2.7 million years ago. It is similar to [[53 Arietis]] and [[Mu Columbae]], other runaway stars from the Orion cluster.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Its spectral class is O9.5Ve, meaning that it is an [[O-type star|O-type]] main-sequence star.{{sfn|SIMBAD AE Aurigae}} The Flaming Star Nebula, is located near IC 410 in the [[celestial sphere]]. IC 410 obtained its name from its appearance in long exposure astrophotographs; it has extensive filaments that make AE Aurigae appear to be on fire.{{sfn|Harrington|1992|p=}}

There are four [[Mira variable]] stars in Auriga: [[R Aurigae]], [[UV Aurigae]], [[U Aurigae]], and [[X Aurigae]], all of which are type M stars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} More specifically, R Aurigae is of type M7III,{{sfn|SIMBAD R Aurigae}} UV Aurigae is of type C6 (a [[carbon star]]),{{sfn|SIMBAD UV Aurigae}} U Aurigae is of type M9,{{sfn|SIMBAD U Aurigae}} and X Aurigae is of type K2.{{sfn|SIMBAD X Aurigae}} R Aurigae, with a period of 457.5 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.9 to a maximum of 6.7. UV Aurigae, with a period of 394.4 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 10.6 to a maximum of 7.4. U Aurigae, with a period of 408.1 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.5 to a maximum of 7.5. X Aurigae, with a particularly short period of 163.8 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.6 to a maximum of 8.0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}}

==== Binary and double stars ====

Auriga is home to several less prominent binary and double stars. [[Theta Aurigae]] (Bogardus, Mahasim) is a blue-white A0p class binary star{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} of magnitude 2.62 with a luminosity of 75 L&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. It has an absolute magnitude of 0.1{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}} and is 165 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Theta Aurigae}} The secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.1, which requires a telescope of {{convert|100|mm|in}} in [[aperture]] to resolve;{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} the two stars are separated by 3.6 [[arcsecond]]s.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} It is the eastern vertex of the constellation's pentagon.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} Theta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of {{convert|17.5|mi|km}} per second. Theta Aurigae additionally has a second optical companion, discovered by [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] in 1852. The separation was at 52 arcseconds in 1978 and has been increasing since then because of the [[proper motion]] of Theta Aurigae, 0.1 arcseconds per year.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The separation of this magnitude 9.2 component was 2.2 arcminutes (130.7 arcseconds) in 2007 with an angle of 350°.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} [[4 Aurigae]] is a double star at a distance of 159 light-years. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 8.1.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} [[14 Aurigae]] is a white [[optical binary]] star. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and is at a distance of 270 light-years; the secondary is of magnitude 7.9 and is at a distance of 82 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} [[HD 30453]] is spectroscopic binary of magnitude 5.9, with a spectral type assessed as either A8m or F0m, and a period of seven days.{{sfn|Fekel|Tomkin|2007|pp=59–60}}{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 1528}}

==== Stars with planetary systems ====

There are five stars with confirmed planetary systems in Auriga; there is also a white dwarf with a suspected planetary system. [[HD 40979]] has one planet, [[HD 40979 b]]. It was discovered in 2002 through [[radial velocity]] measurements on the parent star. HD 40979 is 33.3 [[parsec]]s from Earth, a [[spectral class]] F8V star of magnitude 6.74—just past the limit of visibility to the naked eye. It is of similar size to the Sun, at 1.1 solar masses and 1.21 solar radii. The planet, with a mass of 3.83 [[Jupiter mass]]es, orbits with a semi-major axis of 0.83 [[astronomical unit|AU]] and a period of 263.1 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 40979 b}} [[HD 45350]] has one planet as well. [[HD 45350 b]] was discovered through radial velocity measurements in 2004. It has a mass of 1.79 Jupiter masses and orbits every 890.76 days at a distance of 1.92 AU. Its parent star is faint, at an apparent magnitude of 7.88, a G5IV type star 49 parsecs away. It has a mass of 1.02 solar masses and a radius of 1.27 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 45350 b}} [[HD 43691 b]] is a significantly larger planet, with a mass of 2.49 Jupiter masses; it is also far closer to its parent star, [[HD 43691]]. Discovered in 2007 from radial velocity measurements, it orbits at a distance of 0.24 AU with a period of 36.96 days. HD 43691 has a radius identical to the Sun's, though it is more dense—its mass is 1.38 solar masses. It is a G0IV type star of magnitude 8.03, 93.2 parsecs from Earth.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 43691 b}}

[[HD 49674]] is a star in Auriga with one planet orbiting it. This G5V type star is faint, at magnitude 8.1, and fairly distant, at 40.7 parsecs from Earth. Like the other stars, it is similar in size to the Sun, with a mass of 1.07 solar masses and a radius of 0.94 solar radii. Its planet, [[HD 49674 b]], is a smaller planet, at 0.115 Jupiter masses. It orbits very close to its star, at 0.058 AU, every 4.94 days. HD 49674 b was discovered by radial velocity observations in 2002.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 49674 b}} [[HAT-P-9 b]] is the most recently confirmed exoplanet in Auriga, orbiting the star [[HAT-P-9]]. Unlike the other exoplanets in Auriga, detected by radial velocity measurements, HAT-P-9 b was detected using the [[transit method]] in 2008. It has a mass of 0.67 Jupiter masses and orbits just 0.053 AU from its parent star, with a period of 3.92 days; its radius is 1.4 Jupiter radii, making it a [[hot Jupiter]]. Its parent star, HAT-P-9, is an F-type star approximately 480 parsecs from Earth. It has a mass of 1.28 solar masses and a radius of 1.32 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HAT-P-9 b}}

There is one unconfirmed exoplanet in Auriga. [[GD 66 b]] is a suspected exoplanet with a mass of 2.11 Jupiter masses that orbits every 1650 days at a distance of 2.356 AU. Its existence is hypothesized from stellar oscillation measurements. Its parent star, [[GD 66]], is better understood than its controversial planet. 51 parsecs from Earth, it is a DA-type star of magnitude 15.6. It is less massive than the Sun, at 0.64 solar masses, though it has the same radius as the Sun.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia GD 66 b}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

The [[galactic anticenter]] is located about 3.5° to the east of Beta Aurigae. This marks the point on the celestial sphere opposite the location of the [[Galactic Center]]; hence, this region marks a less extensive and less luminous part of the dust band that forms the spiral arms of the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}}{{sfn|Crossen|Rhemann|2004|p=177}} Auriga has many [[open cluster]]s and other objects because the Milky Way runs through it. The three brightest open clusters are [[Messier 36|M36]], [[Messier 37|M37]] and [[Messier 38|M38]], all of which are visible in binoculars or a small telescope in suburban skies.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}} A larger telescope resolves individual stars. Three other open clusters are [[NGC 2281]], lying close to [[Psi7 Aurigae|ψ&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Aurigae]], [[NGC 1664]], which is close to [[Epsilon Aurigae|ε Aurigae]], and [[IC 410]] (surrounding [[NGC 1893]]), a cluster with nebulosity next to [[IC 405]], the Flaming Star Nebula,{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}} found about mid-way between M38 and ι&amp;nbsp;Aurigae. [[AE Aurigae]], a [[runaway star]], is a bright variable star currently located within the Flaming Star Nebula.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}}

[[File:M36 2mass.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A photograph of M36, clearly showing its characteristic knot of bright stars and its concentration]]

M36 (NGC 1960) is a young galactic open cluster with approximately 60 stars, most of which are relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} It is at a distance of 3900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}}{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} It was discovered in 1749 by [[Guillaume Le Gentil]], the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by [[Struve 737]], a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are [[B type main-sequence star|B type stars]] with rapid rates of rotation.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} M36's [[Trumpler class]] is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}}

[[File:M37.jpg|thumb|200px|A photograph of M37, showing its obviously larger size and its notable brightness]]

M37 (NGC 2099) is an open cluster, larger than M36 and at a distance of 4200 light-years. It has 150 stars, making it the richest cluster in Auriga; the most prominent member is an orange star that appears at the center.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} M37 is approximately 25 light-years in diameter.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} It is the brightest open cluster in Auriga with a magnitude of 5.6;{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}} it has an apparent diameter of 23.0 arcminutes.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} M37 was discovered in 1764 by [[Charles Messier]], the first of many astronomers to laud its beauty. It was described as &quot;a virtual cloud of glittering stars&quot; by [[Robert Burnham, Jr.]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] commented that the star field was &quot;strewed {{sic}}...with sparkling gold-dust&quot;.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The stars of M37 are older than those of M36; they are approximately 200 million years old. Most of the constituent stars are [[A type main-sequence star|A type stars]], though there are at least 12 [[red giant]]s in the cluster as well.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} M37's Trumpler class is given as both I 2 r and II 1 r. The stars visible in a telescope range in magnitude from 9.0 to 13.0; there are two 9th magnitude stars in the center of the cluster and an east to west chain of 10th and 11th magnitude stars.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}}

[[File:Messier 038 2MASS.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A photograph of M38; its characteristic shape, clearly visible to an observer in a telescope, is obscured by the greater number of stars revealed by a long-exposure photograph.]]

M38 is a diffuse open cluster at a distance of 3900 light-years, the least concentrated of the three main open clusters in Auriga;{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} it is classified as a Trumpler Class II 2 r or III 2 r cluster because of this.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} It appears as a cross-shaped or [[pi (letter)|pi]]-shaped object in a telescope and contains approximately 100 stars;{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} its overall magnitude is 6.4.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} M38, like M36, was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. It has an apparent diameter of approximately 20 arcseconds and a true diameter of about 25 light-years. Unlike M36 or M37, M38 has a varied stellar population. The majority of the population consists of A and B type main sequence stars, the B type stars being the oldest members, and a number of [[G type stars|G type giant stars]]. One yellow-hued G type star is the brightest star in M38 at a magnitude of 7.9.{{sfn|Burnham|1978|pp=261–296}} The brightest stars in M38 are magnitude 9 and 10.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} M38 is accompanied by [[NGC 1907]], a smaller and dimmer cluster that lies half a degree south-southwest of M38; it is at a distance of 4200 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86–88}} The smaller cluster has an overall magnitude of 8.2 and a diameter of 6.0 arcminutes, making it about a third the size of M38. However, NGC 1907 is a rich cluster, classified as a Trumpler Class I 1 m n cluster. It has approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10, and at least 25 stars of magnitude 9–12.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}}

IC 410, a faint nebula, is accompanied by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The cluster is thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low [[surface brightness]], partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas in the north and south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument.{{sfn|Higgins|1992|p=}} NGC 1893, of magnitude 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars of magnitude 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} [[NGC 2281]] is a small open cluster at a distance of 1500 light-years.

[[NGC 1931]] is a nebula in Auriga, slightly more than one degree to the west of M36. It is considered to be a difficult target for an amateur telescope. NGC 1931 has an approximate integrated magnitude of 10.1;{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} it is 3 by 3 arcminutes. However, it appears to be elongated in an amateur telescope.{{sfn|Higgins|1992|p=}} Some observers may note a green hue in the nebula; a large telescope will easily show the nebula's &quot;peanut&quot; shape, as well as the quartet of stars that are engulfed by the nebula.{{sfn|Harrington|1992|p=}} The open cluster portion of NGC 1931 is classed as a I 3 p n cluster; the nebula portion is classed as both an [[emission nebula|emission]] and [[reflection nebula]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94–101}} NGC 1931 is approximately 6000 light-years from Earth and could easily be confused with a [[comet]] in the [[eyepiece]] of a telescope.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=97–99}}

NGC 1664 is a fairly large open cluster, with a diameter of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is [[NGC 1778]], with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. [[NGC 1857]], a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is [[NGC 2126]] at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338–340|loc=Table 14.12}}

=== Meteor showers ===

[[File:Aurigids - Jeremie Vaubaillon.jpg|thumb|The 2007 Aurigid outburst observed from 47,000 feet by a NASA mission.]]

Auriga is home to two meteor showers. The [[Aurigids]], named for the entire constellation and formerly called the &quot;Alpha Aurigids&quot;, are renowned for their intermittent outbursts, such as those in 1935, 1986, 1994, and 2007.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175–178}} They are associated with the comet [[Kiess (C/1911 N1)]], discovered in 1911 by [[Carl Clarence Kiess]]. The association was discovered after the outburst in 1935 by [[Cuno Hoffmeister]] and [[Arthur Teichgraeber]].{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=82}} The Aurigid outburst on September 1, 1935 prompted the investigation of a connection with Comet Kiess, though the 24-year delay between the comet's return caused doubt in the scientific community. However, the outburst in 1986 erased much of this doubt. Istvan Teplickzky, a Hungarian amateur meteor observer, observed many bright meteors [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiating]] from Auriga in a fashion very similar to the confirmed 1935 outburst. Because the position of Teplickzky's observed radiant and the 1935 radiant were close to the position of Comet Kiess, the comet was confirmed as the source of the Aurigid meteor stream.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175–178}}

The Aurigids had a spectacular outburst in 1994, when many [[grazing meteors]]—those that have a shallow angle of entry and seem to rise from the horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though there were only a few visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175–178}} The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=82}} The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by [[Peter Jenniskens]] and was observed by astronomers worldwide.{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=117–118}} Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15&amp;nbsp;am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.{{sfn|Jenniskens|Kemp|2007}}

The Aurigids are normally a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in the early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of {{convert|67|km|mi}}/sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of [[Theta Aurigae]], a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation.{{sfn|Lunsford, Activity}} The Aurigids end on September 4.{{sfn|Lunsford, Showers}} Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=117–118}}

The other meteor showers radiating from Auriga are far less prominent and capricious than the Alpha Aurigids. The [[Zeta Aurigids]] are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1–5 meteors per hour. It was discovered by [[William Denning]] in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare [[meteoroid#Fireball|fireballs]] by [[Alexander Stewart Herschel]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=103–104}} There is another faint stream of meteors called the &quot;Aurigids&quot;, unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Delta Aurigids]] are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at [[New Mexico State University]] and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=119}} They may be related to the [[September Perseids]], though they are more similar to the [[Coma Berenicids]] in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors.{{sfn|Dubietis|Arlt|2002}} They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet.{{sfn|Drummond|1982}} The [[Iota Aurigids]] are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid [[2000 NL10]], but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of [[Taurids]].{{sfn|Meng|2002}}

In astronomy, the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer's perspective. Considered a very important effect in astronomy, it is different from [[seasonal constellations]]. Circumpolar [[constellations]] stay in the sky.

Because of the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun, we divide the stars and constellations into two groups. Some stars and constellations never rise nor set, and they are called circumpolar. All the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations. Which stars and constellations will be circumpolar and which seasonal depends on your latitude. In the northern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the northern circumpolar sky, while in the southern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the southern circumpolar sky.

The celestial north pole, currently marked by [[Polaris]], always has an [[azimuth]] equal to zero. Also, its [[altitude]] for a given place is fixed and its value is given by the following formula: A = 90-Ø. All stars with a [[declination]] less than A are not circumpolar.  

They are also visible year round at that location.  From the [[North Pole]], all constellations north of the [[celestial equator]], (all fully visible constellations) are circumpolar, and similarly from the [[South Pole]].  From the [[equator]], there are no circumpolar constellations.  From mid-north latitudes (40–50°N), circumpolar constellations may include [[Ursa Major]], [[Ursa Minor]], [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]],  [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] and the not well known [[Camelopardalis (constellation)|Camelopardalis]].

'''Grus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ʌ|s}}, or colloquially {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|uː|s}}) is a [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[crane (bird)|crane]], a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]] and was depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.  French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] gave [[Bayer designation]]s to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]]. The constellations Grus, [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]], [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Tucana]] are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

The constellation's brightest star, [[Alpha Gruis]], is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] blue-white star. [[Beta Gruis]] is a [[red giant]] [[variable star]] with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet|planets]]: the red dwarf [[Gliese 832]] is one of the closest stars to Earth that has a planetary system. Another—[[WASP-95]]—has a planet that orbits every two days. [[Deep-sky object]]s found in Grus include the [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 5148]], also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.

==History==
[[File:Grus and Piscis Austrinus from Atlas Coelestis.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|The constellations Grus and [[Piscis Austrinus]], which once formed a single constellation, as depicted in ''Atlas Coelestis'' by [[Johann Doppelmayr]], ca. 1742]]

The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]] (the southern fish), with [[Gamma Gruis]] seen as part of the fish's tail.&lt;ref name=tiriongrus&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/grus.htm | title=Grus | work= Star Tales |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]]|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by  the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]], who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in  the German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart | work= Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name ''Den Reygher'', &quot;The Heron&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's catalogue| work= Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.&lt;ref name=tiriongrus/&gt;

An alternative name for the constellation, ''Phoenicopterus'' (Latin &quot;[[flamingo]]&quot;), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work ''Cosmographiae Generalis'' by Paul Merula of [[Leiden University]] and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people.&lt;ref name=tiriongrus/&gt; Grus and the nearby constellations [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]], [[Tucana]] and [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] are collectively called the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;binocs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Patrick|author-link=Patrick Moore|title=Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=2000|page=48|isbn=978-0-521-79390-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jvbtl2Vyxm4C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In [[Chinese astronomy]], Gamma and [[Lambda Gruis]] may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism ''Bàijiù'', along with stars from Piscis Austrinus.&lt;ref name=tiriongrus/&gt; In Central Australia, the [[Upper Arrernte language|Arrernte]] and [[Luritja dialect|Luritja]] people living on a mission in [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg]] viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the [[Milky Way]] representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. [[Alpha Gruis|Alpha]] and [[Beta Gruis]], along with [[Fomalhaut]], [[Alpha Pavonis]] and the stars of [[Musca]], were all claimed by the Arrernte.&lt;ref name=&quot;noctuary&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Diane|title=Night Skies of Aboriginal Australia: a Noctuary|publisher=University of Sydney|location=Darlington, New South Wales|year=1998|pages=70–72|isbn=1-86451-356-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grus is bordered by Piscis Austrinus to the north, [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] to the northeast, Phoenix to the east, Tucana to the south, [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] to the southwest, and [[Microscopium]] to the west.

Caelum constellation is located in the southern hemisphere. Its name is the Latin word for “the chisel,” which it represents in the night sky. The small, faint constellation was originally named Caela Sculptoris, the sculptor’s chisel. Caelum was created by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Caelum is the eighth smallest constellation in the sky, occupying an area of only 125 square degrees. It lies in the first quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ1) and can be seen at latitudes between +40° and -90°.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">__NOTOC__
The current list of 88 [[constellation]]s recognised by the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/| title = The Constellations| author = International Astronomical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm| title = Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on 48 listed by [[Ptolemy]] in the [[Almagest]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/almagest.htm Star Tales – The Almagest]&lt;/ref&gt;. Another 40 were later added by other astronomers, many in the southern hemisphere in areas below the horizon as seen from ancient Greece. Chinese astronomers had their [[Chinese constellations|own traditional star groupings]], as did the Maya&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_astronomy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cultures.

Greek astronomy was built on Mesopotamian foundations. They defined the [[Zodiac]] and at least another 18 constellations taken over or adapted by the Greeks:
:The earliest direct evidence for the constellations comes from inscribed stones and clay writing tablets dug up in Mesopotamia (within modern Iraq)... It appears that the bulk of the Mesopotamian constellations were created within a relatively short interval from around 1300 to 1000 B.C [...] 
:The Mesopotamian groupings turn up in many of the classical Greek constellations. The stars of the Greek Capricorn and Gemini, for example, were known to the Assyrians by similar names - the Goat-Fish and the Great Twins. A total of 20 constellations are straight copies. Another 10 have the same stars but different names. The Assyrian Hired Man and the Swallow, for instance, were renamed Aries and Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of the Greek Constellations'', by [[Bradley E. Schaefer]]. [[Scientific American]], November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sumer]]ian constellations were inherited by [[Babylonian astronomy]]. There are various [[Babylonian star catalogues]] or lists of stars, notably the [[MUL.APIN]], a text dating to the [[Late Bronze Age]], ca. 14th to 12th century BC.

In more recent times, Ptolemy's list has been added to in order to fill gaps between Ptolemy's patterns. Most of the northern sky was filled in by [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Johannes Hevelius]].

The constellations around the South Pole were not observable by the Greeks. Twelve were observed by Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] in the end of sixteenth century and depicted by Johann Bayer in his [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;. Several more were created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in his [[star catalogue]], published in 1756.

Other proposed constellations didn't make the cut, most notably [[Quadrans Muralis|Quadrans]] (now part of between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]) for which the [[Quadrantid]] meteors are named. Also the ancient constellation [[Argo Navis]] was so big that it was broken up into several different constellations, for the convenience of stellar cartographers.

Each culture divides the stars of the night sky into its own set of [[constellation]]s, usually based on [[mythology]]. This article covers the 88 constellations used in modern [[astronomy]], which properly speaking are not patterns of stars, as in the common use of the word, but areas of the sky (the [[celestial sphere]]), and include the constellations of the [[zodiac]].

The ancient [[Sumer]]ians, and later the [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]] (as recorded by [[Ptolemy]]), established most of the northern constellations in international use today. When explorers mapped the stars of the southern skies, European and American astronomers proposed new constellations for that region, as well as ones to fill gaps between the traditional constellations. Not all of these proposals caught on, but in 1922, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the modern list of 88 constellations.&lt;ref name=iau /&gt;  After this, [[Eugène Joseph Delporte]] drew up precise boundaries for each constellation,&lt;ref name=iau&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constellations|url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that every point in the sky belonged to exactly one constellation.

==History==
{{Main|Former constellations}}
Some constellations are no longer recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]], but may appear in older [[star charts]] and other references.  Most notable is [[Argo Navis]], which was one of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] original 48 constellations.

==Modern constellations==
The 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects and 17 humans or mythological characters. For help with the literary English pronunciations, see the [[Help:IPA for English|pronunciation key]]. There is considerable diversity in how Latinate names are pronounced in English. For traditions closer to the original, see [[Latin spelling and pronunciation]].

==Asterisms==
{{Main|Asterism (astronomy)}}

Various other unofficial patterns have existed alongside the constellations.  These are known as &quot;asterisms.&quot; Examples include the [[Big Dipper|Big Dipper/Plough]] and the [[Asterism (astronomy)|Northern Cross]].
Some ancient asterisms, for example [[Coma Berenices]], [[Serpens]], and portions of [[Argo Navis]], are now officially constellations.

[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|250px|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the Dutch cartographer Frederik de Wit]]
A '''star chart''' or '''star map''' is a map of the [[night sky]]. [[Astronomer]]s divide these into grids to use them more easily. They are used to identify and locate [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. They have been used for human [[navigation]] since time immemorial. Note that a star chart differs from an [[astronomical catalog]], which is a listing or tabulation of astronomical objects for a particular purpose. A [[planisphere]] is a type of star chart.

==History==
[[File:Atlas (Farnese Globe).jpg|thumb|200px|''Farnese Atlas'' at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], Naples]]

===Prehistory===
The oldest known star chart may be a carved ivory [[Mammoth]] tusk that was discovered in Germany in 1979. This artifact is 32,500 years old and has a carving that resembles the [[constellation]]
[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This is dated from 33,000 to 10,000 years ago. Researcher Michael A. Rappenglueck has suggested that a panel in the same caves depicting a charging bison, a man with a bird's head and the head of a bird on top of a piece of wood, together may depict the [[summer triangle]], which at the time was a [[circumpolar stars|circumpolar formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Antiquity===
The oldest Chinese astronomy records date to before the [[Warring States period]] (476–221 BC). The oldest Chinese graphical representation of the sky is a lacquer box dated to 430 BC, although this depiction does not show individual stars.

The [[Farnese Atlas]] is a 2nd-century copy of a [[Hellenistic era]] statue depicting the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding the [[celestial sphere]] on his shoulder. It is the oldest surviving depiction of the [[ancient Greek]] constellations, and includes grid circles that provide coordinate positions. Because of [[precession]], the positions of the constellations slowly change over time. By comparing the positions of the 41 constellations against the grid circles, an accurate determination can be made of the [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] when the original observations were performed. Based upon this information, the constellations were catalogued at {{nowrap|125 ± 55 BC}}. This evidence indicates that the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A [[Roman Egypt|Roman era]] example of a graphical representation of the night sky is the Egyptian [[Dendera zodiac]], dating from 50 BC. This is a bas relief sculpting on a ceiling at the [[Dendera Temple complex]]. It is a [[planisphere]] depicting the [[zodiac]] in graphical representations. However, individual stars are not plotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Evans | first=James

===Medieval===
The oldest surviving manuscript star chart was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]] along the [[Silk Road]] – the [[Dunhuang Star Chart]]. This is a scroll 210&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 24.4&amp;nbsp;cm wide showing the sky between [[declination]]s 40° south to 40° north in twelve panels, plus a thirteenth panel showing the northern circumpolar sky. A total of 1,345 stars are drawn, grouped into 257 [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]]. The date of this chart is uncertain, but is estimated as 705–10 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;193247613X&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Su Song Star Map 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Star chart of the [[map projection|south polar projection]] for Chinese astronomer [[Su Song]]'s (1020–1101) [[celestial globe]].]]

During the [[Song dynasty]], the Chinese astronomer [[Su Song]] wrote a book titled ''Xin Yixiang Fa Yao'' (New Design for the Armillary Clock) containing five maps of 1,464 stars. This has been dated to 1092. In 1193, the astronomer [[Huang Shang]] prepared a planisphere along with explanatory text. It was engraved in stone in 1247, and this chart still exists in the Wen Miao temple in [[Suzhou]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jahh12&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In [[Muslim astronomy]], the first star chart to be drawn accurately was most likely the illustrations produced by the Persian astronomer [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] in his 964 work titled ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. This book was an update of parts VII.5 and VIII.1 of the 2nd century [[Almagest]] star catalogue by [[Ptolemy]]. The work of al-Sufi contained illustrations of the constellations and portrayed the brighter stars as dots. The original book did not survive, but a copy from about 1009 is preserved at the [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;193247613X&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jahh12&quot; /&gt;

Perhaps the oldest European star map was a parchment manuscript titled ''De Composicione Spere Solide''. It was most likely produced in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1440 and consisted of a two-part map depicting the constellations of the northern celestial hemisphere and the [[ecliptic]]. This may have served as a prototype for the oldest European printed star chart, a 1515 set of woodcut portraits produced by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Early modern===
[[File:Scutum Sobiescianum.PNG|thumb|right|Hevelius – ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' 1690]]
During the European [[Age of Discovery]], expeditions to the southern hemisphere began to result in the addition of new constellations. These most likely came from the records of two Dutch sailors, [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who in 1595 traveled together to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Their compilations resulted in the 1601 globe of [[Jodocus Hondius]], who added 12 new southern constellations. Several other such maps were produced, including [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title=The measurement of starlight: two centuries of astronomical photometry

  | isbn=0-521-40393-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was the first atlas to chart both celestial hemispheres and it introduced the [[Bayer designation]]s for identifying the brightest stars using the Greek alphabet. The ''Uranometria'' contained 48 maps of Ptolemaic constellations, a plate of the southern constellations and two plates showing the entire northern and southern hemispheres in stereographic polar projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Pole [[Johannes Hevelius]] finished his Firmamentum Sobiescianum star atlas in 1690. It contained 56 large, double page star maps and improved the accuracy in the position of the southern stars. He introduced 11 more constellations ([[Scutum]], [[Lacerta]], [[Canes Venatici]], etc.).

'''The Sea''' or '''the Water''' is an area of the sky in which many water-related, and few land-related, [[constellation]]s occur. This may be because the Sun passed through this part of the sky during the [[rainy season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Most of these constellations are named by [[Ptolemy]]:

* [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the Water-bearer
* [[Capricornus]] the Sea-goat
* [[Cetus]] the Whale
* [[Delphinus]] the Dolphin
* [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] the Great River
* [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the Water serpent
* [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] the Fishes
* [[Piscis Austrinus]], the Southern Fish (not named by Ptolemy)

Sometimes included are the [[Argo Navis|Argo Ship]] and [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]] the Water Cup.

Some water-themed constellations are newer, so are ''not'' in this region. They include [[Hydrus]], the lesser water snake; [[Volans]], the flying fish; and [[Dorado (constellation)|Dorado]], the swordfish.

These constellations were introduced to the public by [[Johann Bayer]] (hence the name) in 1603. All are named after animals, mostly water animals like the water snake (Hydrus) and the goldfish (Dorado).&lt;ref name=Menzel /&gt; Because these constellations are located in the far southern sky, they were not visible for the ancient Greeks and Romans. Bayer acquired them from [[Petrus Plancius]] who had directed others that the southern skies be charted.

These constellations were introduced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] (hence the name) in 1756. Mensa (the table; originally &quot;Mons Mensa&quot; for ''table mountain'') was named after [[Table Mountain]] in South Africa where his observatory was located; the remaining dozen were named after scientific instruments and apparatuses like the telescope, microscope, and [[reticle]].&lt;ref name=Menzel /&gt; Because these constellation are located in the far southern sky, they were not visible for the ancient Greeks and Romans.

See below the section &quot;In fiction&quot;.--&gt; is the fringe of [[astronomy]] and branch of [[cartography]] concerned with mapping stars, galaxies, and other [[astronomical object]]s on the [[celestial sphere]]. Measuring the position and light of charted objects requires a variety of instruments and techniques. These techniques have developed from angle measurements with [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s and the unaided eye, through [[sextant]]s combined with lenses for light magnification, up to current methods which include computer automated space telescopes. Uranographers have historically produced planetary position tables, star tables and star maps for use by both amateur and professional astronomers. More recently computerized star maps have been compiled, and automated positioning of telescopes is accomplished using databases of stars and other astronomical objects.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;uranography&quot; derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;ουρανογραφια&quot; ([[Koine Greek]] ''ουρανος'' &quot;sky, heaven&quot; + ''γραφειν'' &quot;to write&quot;) through the [[Latin]] ''&quot;uranographia&quot;''.  In Renaissance times, ''Uranographia'' was used as the book title of various [[Star cartography#Star atlases|celestial atlases]].&lt;ref&gt;1690: Hevelius J., ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive &lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c. 1750: [[John Bevis|Bevis J.]], ''&lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt; Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1801: Bode. J. E., ''&lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt; sive Astrorum Descriptio''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, &quot;uranography&quot; was defined as the &quot;description of the heavens&quot;. Elijah H. Burritt re-defined it as the &quot;geography of the heavens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burritt, E. H., ''The Geography of the Heavens'', 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; The German word for uranography is &quot;''Uranographie''&quot;, the French is &quot;''uranographie''&quot; and the Italian is &quot;''uranografia''&quot;.

A determining fact source for drawing star charts is naturally a star table. This is apparent when comparing the imaginative &quot;star maps&quot; of ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' – illustrations beside a narrative text from the antiquity – to the star maps of [[Johann Bayer]], based on precise star-position measurements from the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' by [[Tycho Brahe]].

===Important historical star tables===

==In fiction==
{{See also|Galaxy class starship (Star Trek)|Intrepid class starship}}

The term &quot;stellar cartography&quot; was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as the name of a department aboard the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Starship Enterprise-D]]''.  It was also used in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' as the name of the department aboard the ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Starship Voyager]]''.  In both cases, the department was a subsection of the ship's science department, and, as the name would suggest, its responsibilities include charting previously uncharted regions of space as the ship passes through them, as well as operating the ship's astrometrics lab(s). In practice, at least on ''Voyager'', this meant that Stellar Cartography was responsible for all sensor data collection and analysis other than for ship operations (navigation, cursory ship/planet scans, transporter operation, etc.) or combat.

{{IndicText}}
{{Nakshatras}}
'''Nakshatra''' ([[Devanagari]]:   ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'') is the term for [[lunar mansion]] in [[Hindu astrology]]. A nakshatra is one of 27 (sometimes also 28) sectors along the ecliptic. Their names are related to the most prominent  [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the respective sectors.

The starting point for the nakshatras is the point on the ecliptic directly opposite to the star [[Spica]] called ''Chitrā'' in [[Sanskrit]] (other slightly different definitions exist). It is called ''Meshādi'' or the &quot;[[first point of Aries|start of Aries]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
The ecliptic is divided into each of the ''nakshatra''s eastwards starting from this point.
The number of nakshatras reflects the number of days in a [[sidereal month]] (modern value: 27.32 days), the width of a nakshatra traversed by the moon in about one day. Each nakshatra is further subdivided into four quarters (or ''pada''s). These play a role in popular Hindu astrology, where each ''pada'' is associated with a syllable, conventionally chosen as the first syllable of the [[Hindu given names|given name]] of a child born when the moon was in the corresponding ''pada''.

The nakshatras of traditional bhartiya astronomy are based on a list of 28 asterisms found in the [[Atharvaveda]]  (AVŚ 19.7) and also in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The first [[Indian astronomy|astronomical]] text that lists them is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]''.

In classical Hindu mythology ([[Mahabharata]], [[Harivamsa]]), the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to [[Daksha]]. They are personified as daughters of the deity and as mythological wives of [[Chandra]], the moon god, or alternatively the daughters of [[Kashyapa]], the brother of Daksha.&lt;ref&gt;Mythology of the Hindus, by Charles Coleman p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the nakshatras is governed as 'lord' by one of the  [[navagraha|nine graha]] in the following sequence: [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]] (South Lunar Node), [[Shukra]] (Venus),  Ravi or [[Surya]] (Sun), [[Chandra]] (Moon), [[Mangala]] (Mars), [[Rahu]] (North Lunar Node), Guru or [[Brihaspati]] (Jupiter), [[Shani]] (Saturn) and [[Budha]] (Mercury). This cycle repeats itself three times to cover all 27 nakshatras. The lord of each nakshatra determines the planetary period known as the [[Dasha (astrology)|dasha]], which is considered of major importance in forecasting the life path of the individual in Hindu astrology.

In [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the term  ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'' may refer to any heavenly body, or to &quot;the stars&quot; collectively. The classical sense of &quot;lunar mansion&quot; is first found in the [[Atharvaveda]], and becomes the primary meaning of the term in [[Classical Sanskrit]].
&lt;!--The [[Sanskrit verb|verbal root]]  ''{{IAST|nákṣ}}'' means &quot;to approach, come near&quot;.--&gt;

==Nakshatras in the Atharvaveda==
In the [[Atharvaveda]] (Shaunakiya recension, hymn 19.7) a list of 28 stars or asterisms is given, many of them corresponding to the later nakshatras:

Interestingly enough, the term &quot;nakshatra&quot; has a different meaning as demonstrated in the &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; which is an ancient text on astronomy.  In the early chapters, the author, Mayasura or Mayan, describes various time units.  He writes that a &quot;prana&quot; is a duration of 4 seconds.  He then continues with a discussion of a number of time units with progressively long durations made up of the shorter time units all composed of a number of pranas. Amongst those time units are something he calls &quot;nakshatra.&quot; For example, there are 15 pranas in a minute; 900 pranas in an hour; 21600 pranas in a day, 583,200 pranas in a nakshatra (month).   According to Mayan, a nakshatra is a time unit with a duration of 27 days.  This 27 day time cycle has been taken to mean a particular group of stars.  The relationship to the stars really has to do with the periodicity with which the moon travels over time and through space past the field of the specific stars called nakshatras.  Hence, the stars are more like numbers on a clock through which the hands of time pass (the moon).  This concept that nakshatra means a time unit has been lost and diverted to meaning a set of stars in the sky.  This concept was discovered by Dr. Jessie Mercay in her research on Surya Siddhanta.  It is documented in a textbook called &quot;Fundamentals of Mamuni Mayans Vaastu Shastras, Building Architecture of Sthapatya Veda and Traditional Indian architecture.&quot;  (Mercay, 2006 - 2012, AUM Science and Technology publishers)

==List of Nakshatras==
[[File:Nakshatras.jpg|thumb|Position of the Hindu Nakshatra Mandala as per the coordinates specified in Surya Siddhantha]]

The classical list of 27 nakshatras is first found in the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]'', a text dated to the final centuries BCE. The nakshatra system predates the influence of [[Hellenistic astronomy]] on vedic tradition, which became prevalent from about the 2nd century CE.

In Hindu astronomy, there was an older tradition of 28 Nakshatras which were used as celestial markers in the heavens. When these were mapped into equal divisions of the ecliptic, a division of 27 portions was adopted since that resulted in a cleaner definition of each portion (i.e. segment) subtending 13° 20' (as opposed to 12° 51 3/7’ in the case of 28 segments). In the process, the Nakshatra Abhijit was left out without a portion&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite book|first=Ebenezer|last=Burgess|title=Translation of the Surya Siddhantha, a Textbook of Hindu Astronomy|year=1858|publisher=The American Oriental Society|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jpE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}.  The Surya Siddhantha concisely specifies the coordinates of the twenty seven Nakshatras&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;{{rp|211}}

==Padas (quarters)==
The 27 Nakshatras cover 13°20’ of the [[ecliptic]] each. Each Nakshatra is also divided into quarters or ''padas'' of 3°20’, and the below table lists the appropriate starting sound to name the child. The 27 nakshatras, each with 4 padas, give 108, which is the number of beads in a  japa mala, indicating all the elements (ansh) of Vishnu:

==Use in astrology==

===Hindu given names===
Hindu astrologers (see [[Jyotisha]]) teach that when a child is born, they should be given an auspicious first name which will correspond to the child's Nakshatra.
The technique for deducing the name is to see which nakshatra the moon is in at the moment of birth; this gives four possible sounds.  A refinement is to pick one sound out of that four that relates to the Pada or division of the Nakshatra.  Each Nakshatra has four Padas and four sounds and each Pada is of equal width.  The Moon remains in each Nakshatra for approximately one day.

A further refinement or opportunity is to instead use the Nakshatra that the ascendent resides in at birth.  The same broad choice of sounds and Padas apply, but now the sounds change roughly every 15 minutes.  The ascendent passes through all 27 Nakshatras every 24 hours, being in each one for 53 and a third minutes of time, and is in a Pada for 13 and a third minutes of time.  By using the ascendent's nakshatra, instead of the moon's nakshatra leads more to comfort of the Self, rather than comfort of the mother.  This second approach is only really applicable if intuitively the moon approach does not feel right.

===Electional astrology===
Constellations are grouped on the basis of their nature, type of their face, degree of their beneficence, their quarters in different signs, with reference to the constellation occupied by the Sun, with reference to the birth constellation (''Janma Nakshatra''), their caste, etc. The current constellation occupied by the Moon, and its nature forms the fundamental of Vedic system of [[Muhurat|electional astrology]] (''Muhurta''). Some of the activities and works which are associated with the Nakshatras are given below based on their fundamental nature:

*'''Fixed (''Dhruva,  Sthira'') constellations:'''

Rohini, Uttara Bhādrapadā, Uttra Falguni,  and Uttara Ashada

Works allocated to delicate &amp; friendly (''Mridu'') asterisms may also be performed.

* '''Movable (''Chala ,  Chara'') constellations:'''

'''Cancer''' is one of the twelve [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[crab]] and it is commonly represented as one. Its astrological symbol is [[File:Cancer.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♋}}). Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 [[square degree]]s and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star [[Beta Cancri]] having an [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.5. It contains two stars with known [[exoplanet|planets]], including [[55 Cancri]], which has five: one [[Super-Earth|super-earth]] and four [[gas giant]]s, one of which is in the [[habitable zone]] and as of such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. Located at the centre of constellation is [[Beehive Cluster|Praesepe]] (Messier 44), one of the closest [[open cluster]]s to Earth and a popular target for amateur astromers.
 
== Characteristics ==
Cancer is a medium-sized constellation that is bordered by [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the west, [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] to the north, [[Leo Minor]] to the northeast, [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] to the east, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] to the south, and [[Canis Minor]] to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Cnc'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|07|55|19.7973}} and {{RA|09|22|35.0364}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between {{dec|33.1415138}} and {{dec|6.4700689}}.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Cancer, constellation boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union|url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cnc | accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering 506 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 31st of the 88 constellations in size. It can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -60° and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of March.

[[Delta Cancri]], also known as Asellus Australis, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.9, 136 light-years from Earth. Its common name means &quot;southern donkey&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; The star also holds a record for the longest name, &quot;Arkushanangarushashutu,&quot; derived from ancient Babylonian language, which translates to &quot;the southeast star in the Crab.&quot; Delta Cancri also makes it easy to find [[X Cancri]], the reddest star in the sky.

[[Gamma Cancri]], or Asellus Borealis (&quot;northern donkey colt&quot;), is a white-hued A-type subgiant of magnitude 4.7, 158 light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

[[Iota Cancri]] is a wide double star. The primary is a yellow-hued G-type bright giant star of magnitude 4.0, 298 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a white A-type main sequence star of magnitude 6.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; Both can easily be seen with a small telescope.

[[Alpha Cancri]] (Acubens) is a [[double star]] with a primary of magnitude 4.26, 173 [[light-years]] from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 12.0 and is visible in small amateur [[telescopes]]. Its common name means &quot;the claw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; The star’s primary component is a white A-type main sequence dwarf, while the companion is a magnitude 11 star.

[[Zeta Cancri]] or Tegmine (&quot;the shell&quot;) is a [[multiple star system]] that contains at least four stars located 83 light-years from Earth. The two brightest components are a binary star with an [[orbital period]] of 1100 years; the brighter component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 70000.0 and the dimmer component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.2. The brighter component is itself a binary star with a period of 59.5 years; its primary is of magnitude 5.6 and its secondary is of magnitude 6.0. This pair will be at its greatest separation in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

Rho-1 Cancri or [[55 Cancri]] is a binary star approximately 40.9 light-years distant from Earth. 55 Cancri consists of a yellow dwarf and a smaller red dwarf, with five planets orbiting the primary star; one low-mass planet that may be either a hot, water-rich world or a carbon planet and four gas giants. 55 Cancri A, classified as a rare &quot;super metal-rich&quot; star, is one of the top 100 target stars for NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finder mission, ranked 63rd on the list. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B, a suspected binary, appears to be gravitationally bound to the primary star, as the two share common proper motion.

===Deep-sky objects===
Cancer is best known among stargazers as the home of [[Beehive Cluster|Praesepe]] (Messier 44), an [[open cluster]] also called the ''Beehive Cluster'', located right in the centre of the constellation. Located 577 light-years from Earth, it is one of the nearest open clusters to our Solar System. M 44 contains about 50 stars, the brightest of which are of the sixth magnitude. Epsilon Cancri is the brightest member at magnitude 6.3. Praesepe is also one of the larger open clusters visible; it has an area of 1.5 square degrees, or three times the size of the full Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; It is most easily observed when Cancer is high in the sky. North of the Equator, this period stretches from February to May. Ptolemy described the Beehive Cluster as &quot;the nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer.&quot; It was one of the first objects Galileo observed with his telescope in 1609, spotting 40 stars in the cluster. Today, there are about 1010 high-probability members, most of them (68 percent) red dwarfs. The Greeks and Romans identified the nebulous object as a manger from which two donkeys, represented by the neighbouring stars [1213] Asellus Borealis and [1210] Asellus Australis, were eating. The stars represent the donkeys that the god Dionysus and his tutor Silenus rode in the war against the Titans. The ancient Chinese interpreted the object as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage, calling it a &quot;cloud of pollen blown from under willow catkins.&quot;

The smaller, denser open cluster [[Messier 67]] can also be found in Cancer, 2500 light-years from Earth. It has an area of approximately 0.5 square degrees, the size of the full Moon. It contains approximately 200 stars, the brightest of which are of the tenth magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

[[QSO J0842+1835]] is a [[quasar]] used to measure the [[speed of gravity]] in [[VLBI]] experiment conducted by [[Edward Fomalont]] and [[Sergei Kopeikin]] in September 2002.

[[OJ 287]] is a [[BL Lac object]] located 3.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[light years]] away that has produced quasi-periodic optical outbursts going back approximately 120 years, as  first apparent on photographic plates from 1891.  It was first detected at radio wavelengths during the course of the [[Ohio Sky Survey]]. Its central [[supermassive black hole]] is [[List of most massive black holes|among the largest known]], with a mass of 18 billion [[solar masses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite doi|10.1038/nature06896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more than six times the value calculated for the previous largest object.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13166-biggest-black-hole-in-the-cosmos-discovered.html|title= Biggest black hole in the cosmos discovered| date=10 January 2008| publisher= NewScientist.com news service| first= David| last= Shiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cancer is said to have been the place for the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian Sun of the South, perhaps from its position at the [[solstice|summer solstice]] in very remote antiquity. But afterwards it was associated with the fourth month ''Duzu'' (June–July in the modern western calendar), and was known as the Northern Gate of Sun.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Showing but few stars, and its brightest stars being of only 4th [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; Cancer was often considered the &quot;Dark Sign&quot;, quaintly described as black and without eyes. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], alluding to this faintness and position of heavens, wrote in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradiso]]'':
{{cquote|
Then a light among them brightened,&lt;br/&gt;
So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,&lt;br/&gt;
Winter would have a month of one sole day.''}}

Cancer was the location of the Sun's most northerly position in the sky (the [[summer solstice]]) in ancient times, though this position now occurs in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], around June 21. This is also the time that the sun is directly overhead at 23.5°N, a parallel now known as the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

In Greek mythology, Cancer is identified with the crab that appeared while Hercules was fighting the many-headed Hydra. The crab bit Hercules on the foot, Hercules crushed it and then the goddess Hera, a sworn enemy of Hercules, placed the crab among the stars.

The modern symbol for Cancer represents the pincers of a [[crab]], but Cancer has been represented as various types of creatures, usually those living in the water, and always those with an [[exoskeleton]].

In the Egyptian records of about 2000 BC it was described as Scarabaeus ([[Scarab (artifact)|Scarab]]), the sacred [[emblem]] of immortality. In Babylonia the constellation was known as MUL.AL.LUL, a name which can refer to both a crab and a snapping turtle. On boundary stones, the image of a turtle or tortoise appears quite regularly and it is believed that this represent Cancer as a conventional crab has not so far been discovered on any of these monuments. There also appears to be a strong connection between the Babylonian  constellation and ideas of death and a passage to the underworld, which may be the origin of these ideas  in much later Greek myths associated with Hercules and the Hydra.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2008|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, an illustrated astronomical manuscript shows it as a [[water beetle]]. [[Albumasar]] writes of this sign in ''Flowers of Abu Ma'shar''. A 1488 [[Latin language|Latin]] translation depicts cancer as a large [[crayfish]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2997/ |title = Flowers of Abu Ma'shar |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1488 |accessdate = 2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also is the constellation's name in most [[Germanic languages]]. [[Jakob Bartsch]] and [[Stanislaus Lubienitzki]], in the 17th century, described it as a [[lobster]].

==Names==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aratus]] called the crab ''Καρκινος'' (''Karkinos''), which was followed by [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]]. The [[Alfonsine tables]] called it ''Carcinus'', a Latinized form of the Greek word. [[Eratosthenes]] extended this as ''Καρκινος'', ''Ονοι'', ''και Φατνη'' (''Karkinos'', ''Onoi''. ''kai fatne''): the Crab, Asses, and Crib.

The Indian language [[Sanskrit]] shares a common ancestor with Greek, and the Sanskrit name of Cancer is ''Karka'' and ''Karkata''. In [[Telugu language|Telugu]] it is &quot;Karkatakam&quot;, in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] &quot;Karkataka&quot; or &quot;Kataka&quot;, in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''Karkatan'', and in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] ''Kagthaca''. The later Hindus knew it as ''Kulira'', from the Greek ''Κολουρος'' (''Koloyros''), the term originated by [[Proclus]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] and [[Ovid]] called the constellation ''Litoreus'' (shore-inhabiting). ''Astacus'' and ''Cammarus'' appear in various classic writers, while it is called ''Nepa'' in [[Cicero]]'s ''De Finibus'' and the works of [[Columella]], [[Plautus]], and [[Varro]]; all of these words signify crab, [[lobster]], or [[scorpion]].

[[Athanasius Kircher]] said that in Coptic Egypt it was ''Κλαρια'' (''Klaria''), the ''Bestia seu Statio Typhonis'' (the Power of Darkness). [[Jérôme Lalande]] identified this with [[Anubis]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, one of the Egyptian divinities commonly associated with [[Sirius]].

In most [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Slavic languages]], the constellation is known as &quot;The Crayfish&quot;.

==Mythology==
[[File:Lernaean Hydra Louvre CA598 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Heracles]] attacked by Karkinos (bottom) and the [[Lernaean Hydra]], under the aid of [[Athena]]. White-ground [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[lekythos]], ca. 500–475 BC. [[Louvre]] Museum, Paris.]]
The creation of the constellation is explained in Greek mythology by the short-lived association of the crab Karkinos with one of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors of Hercules]], in which Hercules battled the multi-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]]. [[Hera]] had sent Karkinos to distract Hercules and put him at a disadvantage during the battle, but Hercules quickly dispatched the crab by kicking it with such force that it was propelled into the sky. Other accounts had Karkinos grabbing onto Hercules' toe with its claws, but Hercules simply crushed the crab underfoot. Hera, grateful for Karkinos' effort, gave it a place in the sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have suggested that Karkinos was a late addition to the myth of Hercules in order to make the Twelve Labors correspond to the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dibonsmith.com/cnc_con.htm |title=Cancer |publisher=Dibonsmith.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology===
{{Main|Cancer (astrology)}}
{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Cancer from July 21 to August 9. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] from June 21 to July 22, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from July 16 to August 15.

'''Sagitta''' is a [[constellation]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]&quot;, and it should not be confused with the larger constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], the archer. Although Sagitta is an ancient constellation, it has no star brighter than 3rd [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] and has the third-smallest area of all [[constellation]]s (only [[Equuleus]] and [[Crux]] are smaller). It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Located to the north of the equator, Sagitta can be seen from every location on Earth except within the [[Antarctic circle]].

Sagitta lies within the [[Milky Way]] and is bordered by the following constellations (beginning at the north and then continuing clockwise): the little fox [[Vulpecula]], the mythological hero [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], the eagle [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and the dolphin [[Delphinus (constellation)|Delphinus]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:SagittaCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Sagitta as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
===Stars===
The following are some of Sagitta's brightest stars:
 
* [[Alpha Sagittae|α Sge]]: also known as ''[[Sham]]'', this yellow bright giant star of [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] G1&amp;nbsp;II (with 4.37m) lies at a distance of 610 light-years and together with β Sge (also 4.37m) forms either the feathers of the shaft or the two-pointed arrow once used in the Roman army.
* [[Gamma Sagittae|γ Sge]]: this cool giant (M0&amp;nbsp;III, 3.47m) represents with the stars δ Sge and ε Sge the shaft. It lies at a distance of merely 170 light-years.
* [[Delta Sagittae|δ Sge]]: M2&amp;nbsp;II+A0&amp;nbsp;V (suspected visual double; probably single image, composite spectrum), 3.82m
* [[Epsilon Sagittae|ε Sge]]: G8&amp;nbsp;III, 5.66m, multiple star (4 components; component B is optical)
* [[Eta Sagittae|η Sge]]: this star of spectral class K2&amp;nbsp;III with 5.1m belongs to the Hyades [[moving group]].

===Deep-sky objects===
* [[Globular Cluster M71|M71]]: this object is a very loose [[globular cluster]] mistaken for quite some time for a dense [[open cluster]]. It lies at a distance of about 13,000 light-years from Earth and was first discovered by the French astronomer [[Philippe Loys de Chéseaux]] in the year 1745 or 1746.

==History==
The Greeks who may have&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers_98_2&quot;&gt;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1998JBAA..108...79R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=9&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES page 88] in [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108...79R Origins of the ancient constellations: II. The Mediterranean traditions], by J. H. Rogers 1998&lt;/ref&gt; originally identified this constellation called it ''Oistos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Cat_Astraioi2.html Katasterismoi per theoi.com] in [http://www.theoi.com/ theoi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Romans named it Sagitta.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} 

[[Johann Bayer]] chose to name the stars in Sagitta in a non-brightness order, in this case giving the brightest star a designation of γ. Another example of such a deviation from the usual brightness order is the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].

==Mythology==
Sagitta's shape is reminiscent of an arrow, and many cultures have interpreted it thus, among them the [[Persian people|Persians]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Hebrew]]s,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s. The [[Arabs]] called it ''as-Sahm'', a name that was transferred ''Sham'' and now refers to [[Alpha Sagittae|α Sge]] only.

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Delphinus, Sagitta, Aquila, and Antinous.jpg|Sagitta can be seen above [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] in this plate from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).|thumb|left]]
In [[ancient Greece]], Sagitta was regarded as the weapon that Hercules used to kill the eagle (Aquila) of [[Jove]] that perpetually gnawed [[Prometheus]]' liver.&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus_14&quot;&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html#15 Astronomica] by Hyginus, Mary Grant translation at [http://www.theoi.com/ theoi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arrow is located beyond the north border of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], the Eagle. Others believe the Arrow to be the one shot by Hercules towards the adjacent Stymphalian birds (6th labor) who had claws, beaks and wings of iron, and who lived on human flesh in the marshes of [[Arcadia]] - [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila the Eagle]] and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus the Swan]], and [[Lyra|the Vulture]]{{dubious|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--Lyra is the Vulture?--&gt; - and still lying between them, whence the title [[Herculea]]. [[Eratosthenes]] claimed it as the arrow with which [[Apollo]] exterminated the  [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus_14&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ecliptic path.jpg|thumb|The Earth in its orbit around the [[Sun]] causes the Sun to appear on the celestial sphere moving over the [[ecliptic]] (red), which is tilted with respect to the equator (blue-white).]]

In both [[astrology]] and historical [[astronomy]], the '''zodiac''' (Greek: ζῳδιακός, ''zōidiakos'') is a circle of twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the [[ecliptic]]: the apparent path of the [[Sun]] across the [[celestial sphere]] over the course of the year. The paths of the [[Moon]] and visible [[planet]]s also remain close to the ecliptic, within the belt of the zodiac, which extends 8-9° north or south of the ecliptic, as measured in [[celestial latitude]]. Because the divisions are regular, they do not correspond exactly to the twelve [[constellations]] after which they are named.

Historically, these twelve divisions are called [[astrological sign|signs]]. Essentially, the zodiac is a [[celestial coordinate system]], or more specifically an [[ecliptic coordinate system]], which takes the ecliptic as the origin of [[celestial latitude|latitude]], and the position of the sun at [[vernal equinox]] as the origin of [[celestial longitude|longitude]].

The zodiac was in use by the [[Roman era]], based on concepts inherited by [[Hellenistic astronomy]] from [[Babylonian astronomy]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian|Chaldean period]] (mid-1st millennium BC), which, in turn, derived from an earlier system of lists of stars along the ecliptic.&lt;ref&gt;see [[MUL.APIN]].

The term ''zodiac'' derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''zōdiacus'', which in its turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ζῳδιακὸς κύκλος}} (''zōdiakos kyklos''), meaning &quot;circle of animals&quot;, derived from {{lang|grc|ζῴδιον}} (''zōdion''), the diminutive of {{lang|grc|ζῷον}} (''zōon'') &quot;animal&quot;. The name is motivated by the fact that half of the signs of the classical Greek zodiac are represented as animals (besides two [[mythological hybrid]]s).

Although the zodiac remains the basis of the [[ecliptic coordinate system]] in use in [[astronomy]] besides the [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial]] one,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Lee T. &quot;[http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder3/ Constellations in the zodiac.]&quot; [[NASA]]. April 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the term and the names of the twelve signs are today mostly associated with [[horoscopic astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]], &quot;History of the zodiac&quot;, ''Archiv für Orientforschung'' '''16''' (1953) 216–230.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;zodiac&quot; may also refer to the region of the [[celestial sphere]] encompassing the paths of the planets corresponding to the band of about eight arc degrees above and below the ecliptic. The zodiac of a given planet is the band that contains the path of that particular body; e.g., the &quot;zodiac of the Moon&quot; is the band of five degrees above and below the ecliptic. By extension, the &quot;zodiac of the comets&quot; may refer to the band encompassing most [[short-period comet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], citing [[John Harris (writer)|J. Harris]], ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704): &quot;Zodiack of the Comets, [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] hath observed a certain Tract  [...] within whose Bounds [...] he hath found most Comets [...] to keep.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===
[[File:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|Wheel of the zodiac: This 6th century mosaic pavement in a synagogue incorporates Greek-Byzantine elements, [[Beit Alpha]], [[Israel]].]]

{{further|Babylonian star catalogues|MUL.APIN}}
The division of the ecliptic into the zodiacal signs originates in [[Babylonia]]n (&quot;[[Chaldea]]n&quot;) astronomy during the first half of the [[1st millennium BC]], likely during [[Median Empire|Median]]/&quot;[[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]]&quot; times (7th century BC),&lt;ref&gt;Powell 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
The classical zodiac is a modification of the [[MUL.APIN]] catalogue, which was compiled around 1000 BC.
Some of the constellations can be traced even further back, to Bronze Age (Old Babylonian) sources,  including [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] &quot;The Twins&quot;, from MAŠ.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL &quot;The Great Twins&quot;, and [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] &quot;The Crab&quot;, from AL.LUL &quot;The Crayfish&quot;, among others.

[[Babylonia]]n astronomers at some stage during the early 1st millennium BC divided the ecliptic into twelve equal ''zones'' of [[celestial longitude]] to create the first known celestial coordinate system: a coordinate system that boasts some advantages over modern systems (such as the [[equatorial coordinate system]]). The [[Babylonian calendar]] as it stood in the 7th century BC assigned each month to a sign, beginning with the position of the Sun at [[vernal equinox]], which, at the time, was depicted as the [[Aries (constellation)|Aries constellation]] (&quot;[[Age of Aries]]&quot;), for which reason the first sign is still called &quot;[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]&quot; even after the vernal equinox has moved away from the Aries constellation due to the slow precession of the Earth's axis of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thurston, Early Astronomy, (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1994), p. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the division was made into equal arcs, 30º each, they constituted an ideal system of reference for making predictions about a planet's longitude. However, Babylonian techniques of observational measurements were in a rudimentary stage of evolution and it is unclear whether they had techniques to define in a precise way the boundary lines between the zodiacal signs in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs (1948), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the need to use stars close to the ecliptic (±9º of latitude) as a set of observational reference points to help positioning a planet within this ecliptic coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Constellations were given the names of the signs and [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] could be connected in a way that would resemble the sign's name. Therefore, in spite of its conceptual origin, the Babylonian zodiac became sidereal.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), pp. 17, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], a planet position was generally given with respect to a zodiacal sign alone, less often in specific degrees within a sign.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When the degrees of longitude were given, they were expressed with reference to the 30º of the zodiacal sign, i.e., not with a reference to the continuous 360º ecliptic.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; To the construction of their mathematical ephemerides, daily positions of a planet were not as important as the dates when the planet crossed from one zodiacal sign to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the Babylonian zodiac is also reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[E. W. Bullinger]] interpreted the creatures appearing in the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,&lt;ref&gt;E.W. Bullinger, ''The Witness of the Stars''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. James Kennedy, ''The Real Meaning of the Zodiac''.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Lion as [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], the Bull is [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], the Man representing Aquarius and the Eagle representing Scorpio.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', Vol. 1 (New York: Dover Publications, 1899, p. 213-215.) argued for ''Scorpio'' having previously been called ''Eagle''. for Scorpio.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have linked the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] with the twelve signs. [[Ernest L. Martin|Martin]] and others have argued that the arrangement of the tribes around the [[Tabernacle]] (reported in the [[Book of Numbers]]) corresponded to the order of the Zodiac, with [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]] representing the middle signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest L. Martin]], ''The Birth of Christ Recalculated'' (Pasadena, California: Foundation for Biblical Research, second ed., 1980), p. 167ff.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Guthrie, J.A. Motyer (ed.), ''The New Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., third ed., 1970) p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Such connections were taken up by [[Thomas Mann]], who in his novel ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' attributes characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe in his rendition of the [[Blessing of Jacob]].

Babylonia or [[Chaldea]] in the Hellenistic world came to be so identified with astrology that &quot;Chaldean wisdom&quot; became among [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] the synonym of [[divination]] through the [[planets]] and [[star]]s. 
[[Hellenistic astrology]] derived in part from Babylonian and [[Ancient Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrologer.com/aanet/pub/transit/jan2005/babylonian.htm Powell, Robert,  ''Influence of Babylonian Astronomy on the Subsequent Defining of the Zodiac''] (2004), PhD thesis, summarized by anonymous editor, [http://web.archive.org/web/20090521081306/http://www.astrologer.com/aanet/pub/transit/jan2005/babylonian.htm Wayback version].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Horoscopic astrology]] first appeared in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. The [[Dendera zodiac]], a relief dating to ca. 50 BC, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.

Particularly important in the development of Western horoscopic astrology was the astrologer and astronomer [[Tetrabiblos|Ptolemy]], whose work ''Tetrabiblos'' laid the basis of the [[Western astrological tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, George, 1994. ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam''. New York: New York University Press. ISBN 978-0-8147-8023-7. Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Greeks, and Ptolemy in particular, the planets, Houses, and signs of the zodiac were rationalized and their function set down in a way that has changed little to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Derek and Julia Parker, Ibid, p16, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy lived in the 2nd century AD, three centuries after the discovery of the [[precession of the equinoxes]] by [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC, but he ignored the problem by dropping the concept of a fixed celestial sphere and adopting what is referred to as a [[Tropical astrology|tropical coordinate system]] instead.

=== Hindu zodiac ===
The [[Hindu zodiac]] uses the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal coordinate system]], which makes reference to the fixed stars. The Tropical zodiac (of Mesopotamian origin) is divided by the intersections of the [[ecliptic]] and [[equator]], which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1° every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as [[precession of the equinoxes]]. The Hindu zodiac, being sidereal, does not maintain this seasonal alignment, but there are still similarities between the two systems. The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical. For example, ''dhanu'' means &quot;bow&quot; and corresponds to Sagittarius, the &quot;archer&quot;, and ''kumbha'' means &quot;water-pitcher&quot; and corresponds to Aquarius, the &quot;water-carrier&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Angers Cathedral South Rose Window of Christ with Zodiac.jpg|thumb|Angers Cathedral South Rose Window of Christ (centre) with elders (bottom half) and Zodiac (top half). Mediaeval stained glass by Andre Robin after the fire of 1451]]

The High Middle Ages saw a revival of [[Greco-Roman magic]], first in [[Kabbalism]] and later continued in [[Renaissance magic]]. This included magical uses of the zodiac, as found, e.g., in  the [[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]].

The zodiac is found in mediaeval [[stained glass]] as at [[Angers Cathedral]], where the master glassmaker, André Robin, made the ornate [[rosette window|rosettes]] for the North and South transepts after the fire there in 1451.&lt;ref&gt;King, David.

=== Early modern ===

[[File:Zodiac mtskheta.jpg|thumb|upright|17th-century fresco, [[Svetitskhoveli|Cathedral of Living Pillar]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] of [[Christ]] in the Zodiac circle]]

An example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the ''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767''. The &quot;Longitude of the Sun&quot; columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/nauticalalmanac07offigoog Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767]''. London: Board of Longitude, 1766.&lt;/ref&gt;

The zodiacal symbols are Early Modern simplifications of conventional pictorial representations of the signs, attested since Hellenistic times.

== The twelve signs ==
{{Main|Astrological sign}}

What follows is a list of the twelve signs of the modern zodiac (with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points), where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox, with their Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian names (but note that the Sanskrit and the Babylonian name equivalents denote the constellations only, not the tropical zodiac signs). Also, the &quot;English translation&quot; is not usually used by English speakers. The Latin names are standard English usage.

== Constellations ==
{{constellations_ecliptic_equirectangular_plot.svg}}
The [[astrological sign|zodiacal signs]] are distinct from the [[constellation]]s associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the [[precession of equinoxes]] but also because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Edward W.|title=Philosophy of science and the occult.|year=1982|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0873955722|editor=Patrick Grim}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Thus, [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] takes up five times as much [[ecliptic longitude]] as  [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]. The zodiacal signs are an abstraction from the physical constellations, and each represent exactly one twelfth of the full circle, or the longitude traversed by the Sun in about 30.4 days.&lt;ref&gt;30.4368 [[SI days]] or 2629743 seconds in [[tropical astrology]] and  30.4380 [[SI days]] or 2629846 seconds in [[sidereal astrology]] on average (the time spent by the Sun in each sign varies slightly due to the eccentricity of the [[Earth's orbit]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some &quot;parazodiacal&quot; constellations are also touched by the paths of the planets. The [[MUL.APIN]] lists [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. Furthermore, there are a number of constellations mythologically associated with the zodiacal ones : [[Piscis Austrinus]], The Southern Fish, is attached to Aquarius. In classical maps, it swallows the stream poured out of Aquarius' pitcher, but perhaps it formerly just swam in it. [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], The Eagle, was possibly associated with the zodiac by virtue of its main star, [[Altair]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] in the Early Bronze Age marked the [[celestial equator]] and was associated with Leo, which is shown standing on the serpent on the [[Dendera zodiac]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Corvus (constellation)|Corvus]] is the Crow or Raven mysteriously perched on the tail of Hydra.

Due to the [[constellation boundaries]] being redefined in 1930 by the [[International Astronomical Union]], the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' plus  [[Ophiuchus]], the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. Ophiuchus is an anciently recognized constellation, catalogued along with many others in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', but not historically referred to as a zodiac constellation.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Christian Heinrich Friedrich and Edward Ball Knobel. ''[http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/almagest/Peters.htm Ptolemy's Catalogue of Stars: a revision of the Almagest]''.

Catesby Taliaferro |page=239 |chapter=VII.5}} Ptolemy refers to the constellation as ''Septentarius'' 'the serpent holder'.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaccurate description of Ophiuchus as a [[Astrological sign|''sign'' of the zodiac]] drew media attention in 1995, when the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News]]'' reported that &quot;an extra sign of the zodiac has been announced by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kollerstrom, N. |title=Ophiuchus and the media |journal=The Observatory |date=October 1995 |volume=115 |pages=261–262 |publisher=KNUDSEN; OBS |bibcode=1995Obs...115..261K}} [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1995Obs...115..261K/0000262.000.html Reproduced online] at SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), retrieved 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There had been no such announcement, and the report had merely sensationalized the 67-year-old 'news' of the IAU's decision to alter the number of designated ecliptic constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kollerstrom, N. |title=Ophiuchus and the media |journal=The Observatory |date=October 1995 |volume=115 |pages=261–262 |publisher=KNUDSEN; OBS |bibcode=1995Obs...115..261K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The notion received further international media attention in January 2011, when it was reported that astronomer Parke Kunkle, a board-member of the Minnesota Planetarium Society, had suggested that Ophiuchus was the zodiac's '13th sign'. He later issued a statement to say he had not reported that the zodiac ought to include 13 signs instead of 12, but was only mentioning that there were 13 constellations; reported in ''Mad Astronomy'': [http://io9.com/5733004/your-zodiac-sign-may-have-changed-this-week Why did your zodiac sign change?] 13 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Table of dates ==
The following table compares the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] dates on which the Sun enters
*a sign in the Ptolemaic [[tropical astrology|tropical]] zodiac
*a sign in the [[Jyotisha|Hindu]] [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]] system
*the astronomical constellation of the same name as the sign, with constellation boundaries as defined in 1930 by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

The theoretical beginning of Aries is the moment of [[vernal equinox]], and all other dates shift accordingly.
The precise Gregorian times and dates vary slightly from year to year as the Gregorian calendar shifts relative to the [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;The Gregorian calendar is built to satisfy the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which placed vernal equinox is on 21 March, but it is not possible to keep it on a single day within a reasonable system of leap days.&lt;/ref&gt; These variations remain within less than two days' difference in the recent past and the near-future,  vernal equinox in [[Universal Time|UT]] always falling either on  20 or 21 March in the period of 1797 to 2043, falling on 19 March in 1796 the last time and in 2044 the next.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ns1763.ca/equinox/eqindex.html Jean Meeus, Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon, and Planets, 1983 published by Willmann-Bell, Inc., Richmond, Virginia].

Because the Earth's axis is at an angle, some signs take longer to rise than others, and the farther away from the [[equator]] the observer is situated, the greater the difference. Thus, signs are spoken of as &quot;long&quot; or &quot;short&quot; ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Parker &quot;The Astrologer's Handbook&quot;, pp 10, Alva Press, NJ, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precession of the equinoxes ==
{{Further|Axial precession|Epoch (astronomy)|Sidereal and tropical astrology|Astrological age|Ayanamsa}}
[[File:Equinox path.png|thumb|300px|Path taken by the point of [[vernal equinox]] along the ecliptic over the past 6000 years]]

The zodiac system was developed in [[Neo-Babylonian|Babylonia]], some 2,500 years ago, during the &quot;[[Age of Aries]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Abraham (1948), &quot;A Classification of the Babylonian Astronomical Tablets of the Seleucid Period&quot;, ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'', Vol. 2, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;271–290&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it is assumed, the [[precession of the equinoxes]] was unknown, as the system made no allowance for it. Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]], with the signs fixed to the [[Fixed stars|stellar background]], or as [[tropical astrology|tropical]], with the signs fixed to the point of [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg, Francesca (1998), &quot;Babylonian Horoscopes&quot;, ''American Philosophical Society'', New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1, pp i-164&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western astrology]] takes the tropical approach, whereas [[Hindu astrology]] takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise(westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.

For the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical ''sign'' of Aries currently lies somewhere within the ''constellation'' Pisces (&quot;[[Age of Pisces]]&quot;).

The sidereal coordinate system takes into account the [[ayanamsa]], a Sanskrit word where literally ''ayan'' means transit or movement and ''amsa'' means small part i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but Bhaskar-ii in Siddhanta Shiromani gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of Suryasiddhanta plus the equation of Munjaala.

It is not entirely clear how the Hellenistic astronomers responded to this phenomenon of precession once it had been discovered by [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC. Today, some read [[Ptolemy]] as dropping the concept of a fixed celestial sphere and adopting what is referred to as a tropical coordinate system instead: in other words, one fixed to the Earth's seasonal cycle rather than the distant stars.

Some modern Western astrologers, such as [[Cyril Fagan]], have advocated abandoning the tropical system in favour of a sidereal one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cyril-fagan Cyril Fagan]  Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern astronomy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

{{Further|Epoch (astronomy)}}
The zodiac is a [[spherical coordinate system|spherical]] [[celestial coordinate system]]. It  designates the [[ecliptic]] as its fundamental plane and the position of the Sun at [[Vernal equinox]] as its [[prime meridian]].

In astronomy, the zodiacal constellations are a convenient way of marking the ecliptic (the Sun's path across the sky) and the path of the [[moon]] and [[planet]]s along the ecliptic.
Modern astronomy still uses tropical coordinates for predicting the positions the Sun, Moon, and planets, except longitude in the [[ecliptic coordinate system]] is numbered from 0° to 360°, not 0° to 30° within each sign. Longitude within individual signs was still being used as late as 1740 by [[Jacques Cassini]] in his ''Tables astronomiques''.

Zodiac is also used to refer to the [[zodiacal cloud]] of dust grains that move among the planets and the [[zodiacal light]] that originates from their scattering of sunlight.

Unlike the zodiac signs in astrology, which are all thirty degrees in length, the astronomical constellations vary widely in size. The boundaries of all the constellations in the sky were set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1930. This was, in essence, a mapping exercise to make the work of astronomers more efficient, and the boundaries of the constellations are not therefore in any meaningful sense an 'equivalent' to the zodiac signs. Along with the twelve original constellations, the boundaries of a thirteenth constellation, [[Ophiuchus]] (the [[Serpens|serpent]] bearer), were set by astronomers within the bounds of the zodiac.

==Mnemonics==
There are many [[mnemonic]]s for remembering the 12 signs of the zodiac in order. A traditional mnemonic:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17282/17282.txt Project Gutenberg ebook] &quot;An Alphabet Of Old Friends&quot;; see Z for Zodiac.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;The ram, the bull, the heavenly twins,
And next the crab, the lion shines,
The virgin and the scales,
The scorpion, archer, and the goat,
The man who holds the watering-pot,
And fish with glittering scales.&lt;/poem&gt;

A less poetic, but succinct mnemonic is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Rey, H.A. (1952). ''The Stars'', Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;The Ramble Twins Crab Liverish;
Scaly Scorpions Are Good Water Fish.&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Pyxis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|s|ɨ|s}}; {{lang-el|[[box]]}}) is a small and faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for a [[mariner's compass]] (it should not be confused with [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]], which represents a [[draftsman's compasses]]). Pyxis is completely visible from latitudes south of [[53rd parallel north|53 degrees north]], with its best evening-sky visibility in January through March. The brightest star is [[Alpha Pyxidis]] at magnitude 3.68.

Pyxis was introduced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in the 18th century; he called it '''Pyxis Nautica''', but the name was shortened. The constellation is located close to those forming the old constellation of [[Argo Navis]] (the ship ''Argo''), and in the 19th century astronomer [[John Herschel]] suggested renaming Pyxis to 'Malus, the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]', but the suggestion was not followed.
&lt;!-- Editors please note that Pyxis is _not_ one of the parts into which Lacaille split Argo. Many people get this wrong!--&gt;

==History==
Pyxis is the smallest and faintest of four modern constellations carved out of the classical Greek constellation [[Argo Navis]] (the Ship of the Argonauts), the others being [[Puppis]] (the &quot;Stern&quot;), [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the &quot;Keel&quot;), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the &quot;Sails&quot;) by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]].&lt;ref&gt;John Scalzi (2008) Rough Guide to the Universe, p. 240 (ISBN 9781405383707).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David H. Kelley, et al. (2011) Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy , p. 12  (9781441976246).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Winterburn (2009) The Stargazer's Guide, p. 124 (ISBN 9780061976377).&lt;/ref&gt;   The Greeks identified the stars of Pyxis as the mast of the great ship.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Stott, et al. (2006) Eyewitness Companions: Astronomy, p. 210 (ISBN 9780756648459).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although the other three parts of Argo Navis have retained their classical identification, Lacaille described the new constellation, not as a mast, but as ''la Boussole'' (the &quot;Marine Compass&quot;) and gave [[Bayer designation]]s to ten stars formerly in Vela and now named Alpha to Lambda Pyxidis (skipping the Greek letter iota). He labelled it Pyxis Nautica on his 1763 chart.
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Uraniæ, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Pyxis can be seen carved out of [[Argo Navis]] in this plate from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
[[John Herschel]] (in 1844) attempted to resurrect the classical configuration by renaming it Malus (the &quot;Mast&quot;), as did [[Francis Baily]], but [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]] restored La Caille's nomenclature.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=261-62}}&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences--&gt;

[[Johann Bode]] (1747-1826) created the constellation  Lochium Funis (the &quot;Log and Line,&quot; a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance traveled at sea) around Pyxis but this did not survive.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Pyxis}}

In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis formed part of ''Tianmiao'' a Celestial Temple honouring the ancestors of the Emperor, along with stars from neighbouring [[Antlia]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Pyxis}}

== Characteristics ==
Pyxis is a small constellation bordered by [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] to the north, [[Puppis]] to the west, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] to the south, and Antlia to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Pyx'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments.  In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|10|32.8}} and {{RA|27|42.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −17.41° and −37.29°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Pyxis}}

== Notable features ==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Pyxis}}

With a visual magnitude of  3.68, [[Alpha Pyxidis]] is the brightest star in the constellation. It is a blue-white star of spectral type B1.5III which lies around 850 light years away.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alpha Pyxidis''}} The second brightest star at magnitude 3.97 is [[Beta Pyxidis]], a yellow [[bright giant]] or [[supergiant]] of spectral type G7Ib-II around 420 light years distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Pyxidis}} It has a companion star of magnitude 12.5 separated by 9 arcseconds.{{sfn|SIMBAD CD-34 5128B}} [[Gamma Pyxidis]] is an orange giant of spectral type K3III which lies around 209 light years distant. Its visual magnitude is 4.03.{{sfn|SIMBAD Gamma Pyxidis}} [[Kappa Pyxidis]] was catalogued but not given a Bayer designation (Greek letter) by Lacaille, however Gould felt the star was bright enough to warrant a letter.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=261-62}} A multiple star system, Kappa has a visual magnitude of 4.58 and is 560 light years distant. The primary component is an orange giant of spectral type K4/K5III.{{sfn|SIMBAD Kappa Pyxidis}} [[Theta Pyxidis]] is a [[red giant]] of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average visual magnitude of 4.71. It is 522 light years distant.{{sfn|Tabur|Bedding|2009}}

Located around 4 degrees northeast of Alpha is [[T Pyxidis]],{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|pp=383–84}}  a binary star system located around 3,300 light-years away from Earth. A [[nova#Recurrent novae|recurrent nova]], it has brightened to the 7th magnitude in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011 from a baseline of around 14th magnitude.

[[TY Pyxidis]] is an eclipsing binary star of combined visual magnitude 6.9. The two components are both of spectral type G5IV,{{sfn|SIMBAD TY Pyxidis}} have a mass of 1.2 solar masses and size of 1.65 that of our sun, and revolve around each other every 3.2 days.{{sfn|Andersen|Popper|1975}} The system is classified as a [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable]] and lies around 184 light years away.{{sfn|SIMBAD TY Pyxidis}} [[RZ Pyxidis]] is another eclipsing binary system, made up of two young stars less than 200,000 years old. Both are hot blue-white stars of spectral type B7V and are around 2.5 times the size of our sun. One is around five times as luminous as the sun and the other around four times as luminous.{{sfn| Bell|Malcolm|1987}} The system is classified as a [[Beta Lyrae variable]], with an average visual magnitude of 9.1 and lies around 1220 light years away.{{sfn|SIMBAD RZ Pyxidis}} [[AK Pyxidis]] is a red giant of spectral type M5III and semi-regular variable with an average visual magnitude of 6.42. It lies 771 light years away.{{sfn|Tabur|Bedding|2009}}

The closest star to earth in the constellation is [[Gliese 318]], a white dwarf of spectral class DA5 and visual magnitude 12.00,{{sfn|SIMBAD GJ 318}} which lies 26 light years away.{{sfn|Sion|2009}}  [[WISEPC J083641.12-185947.2]] is a [[brown dwarf]] located around 72 light years from earth which was discovered by infrared astronomy in 2011.

Pyxis is home to three stars with confirmed planetary systems: [[HD 73256]] is a yellow star of spectral type G9V with a [[hot Jupiter]], [[HD 73256 b]], orbiting it every 2.55 days. It is 119 light years away. [[HD 73267]] is a star with its companion [[HD 73267 b]] orbiting every 1260 days. [[Gliese 317]] is a [[red dwarf]] around 50 light years distant which is orbited by two gas giant planets, and is a good candidate for future searches for more terrestrial rocky planets.{{sfn|Anglada-Escude|2012}}

===Deep sky objects===
Pyxis lies in the plane of the Milky Way, although part of the eastern edge is dark, with material obscuring our galaxy arm there. [[NGC 2818]] is a [[planetary nebula]] which lies within a dim [[open cluster]] of magnitude 8.2.{{sfn|Inglis|2004|p=39}} [[NGC 2613]] is a spiral galaxy of magnitude 10.5 which appears spindle shaped as it is almost edge-on to observers on Earth.{{sfn|O'Meara|2007|p=82}}

[[Henize 2-10]] is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light years away. It is notable for having a black hole around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a [[starburst galaxy]] due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the huge numbers of young stars within it.{{sfn|Henize 2-10}}

==In popular culture==
* In the anime ''[[Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas]]'', Pyxis is represented by Rusk, pupil of [[Capricorn El Cid]].
* In the TV series ''[[Kamen Rider Fourze]]'', one of the Zodiarts is a Pyxis Zodiarts.
* In the anime and toyline of ''[[Beyblade]]: Metal Masters'', there is a Beyblade misspelled as &quot;Flame Byxis&quot;.
* In the TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', one of the ships is called ''[[List of ships in Battlestar Galactica#Pyxis|Pyxis]]''.

'''Pisces'''  is a constellation of the zodiac. Its name is the Latin plural for fish, and its symbol is   ♓ . It lies between [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] to the west and [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] to the east. The [[ecliptic]] and the [[celestial equator]] intersect within this constellation and in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].

== Notable features ==

[[File:PiscesCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Pisces as it can be seen by naked eye.]]

The [[Vernal equinox]] is currently located in Pisces, due south of ω Psc, and, due to [[precession]], slowly drifting below the western fish towards [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]].

=== Stars ===

[[Van Maanen's Star]], at 12.36 magnitude, is located in this constellation, along with others, such as [[HD 222410]], at 7.45 magnitude.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

[[Messier 74|M74]] is a loosely-wound (type Sc) [[spiral galaxy]] in Pisces, found at a distance of 30 million light years ([[redshift]] 0.0022). It has many clusters of young stars and the associated [[nebula]]e, showing extensive regions of [[star formation]]. It was discovered by [[Pierre Méchain]], a French astronomer, in 1780. A [[type II-P supernova]] was discovered in the outer regions of M74 by [[Robert Evans (astronomer)|Robert Evans]] in June 2003; the star that underwent the supernova was later identified as a [[red supergiant]] with a mass of 8 [[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt;

[[CL 0024+1654]] is a massive [[galaxy cluster]] that [[gravitational lensing|lenses]] the galaxy behind it, creating arc-shaped images of the background galaxy. The cluster is primarily made up of yellow [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and spiral galaxies, at a distance of 3.6 billion light-years from Earth (redshift 0.4), half as far away as the background galaxy, which is at a distance of 5.7 billion light-years (redshift 1.67).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt;

[[3C 31]] is an [[active galaxy]] and [[Astronomical radio source|radio source]] in Perseus located at a distance of 237 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0173). Its jets, caused by the [[supermassive black hole]] at its center, extend several million light-years in both directions, making them some of the largest objects in the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins Dunn 2006&quot; /&gt;

== History and Mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pisces.jpg|thumb|300px|left|From ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1824)]]
Pisces originates from some composition of the [[Babylonian constellation]]s ''Šinunutu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' &quot;the great swallow&quot; in current western Pisces, and ''Anunitum'' the Lady of the Heaven, at the place of the northern fish. In the first Millennium BCE texts known as the ''[[Astronomical Diaries]]'', part of the constellation was also called '''DU.NU.NU''' (''Rikis-nu.mi'', &quot;the fish cord or ribbon&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions] by J. H. Rogers 1998, [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=10&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES page 19] [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=18&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES page 19 (table 3, rows 2-3) and page 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pisces is associated with [[Aphrodite]] and [[Eros]], the who escaped from the monster [[Typhon]] by leaping into the sea and transforming themselves into fish.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen, A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 94 (2007, ISBN 978-1931559386).&lt;/ref&gt;   In order not to lose each other, they tied themselves together with rope. The Romans adopted the Greek legend, with [[Venus]] and [[Cupid]] acting as the counterparts for Aphrodite and Eros. The knot of the rope is marked by [[Alpha Piscium]] (α Psc), also called [[Al-Rischa]] (&quot;the cord&quot; in Arabic).{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=45–47}}

In 1690, the astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]] in his ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'' regarded the constellation Pisces as being composed of four subdivisions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hevelius&quot; /&gt;
* '''Piscis Boreus''' (the North Fish): σ – 68 – 65 – 67 – ψ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; – ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ψ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; – χ – φ – υ – 91 – τ – 82 – 78 Psc.
* '''Linum Boreum''' (the North Cord):&lt;ref name=&quot;Hevelius&quot; /&gt; χ – ρ,94 – VX(97) – η – π – ο – [[Alpha Piscium|α]] Psc.
* '''Linum Austrinum''' (the South Cord):&lt;ref name=&quot;Hevelius&quot; /&gt; α – ξ – ν – μ – ζ – ε – δ – 41 – 35 – ω Psc.
* '''Piscis Austrinus''' (the South Fish):&lt;ref name=&quot;Hevelius&quot; /&gt; ω – ι – θ – 7 – β – 5 – κ,9 – λ – TX(19) Psc.

In 1754, the astronomer [[John Hill (author)|John Hill]] proposed to treat part of Pisces as a separate constellation, called '''Testudo''' (the Turtle)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However the proposal was largely neglected by other astronomers with the exception of [[William Henry Smyth|Admiral Smyth]], who mentioned it in his book ''The Bedford Catalogue'', and it is now [[Former constellations|obsolete]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, W. H., (1884) ''The Bedford Catalogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pisces Hevelius.jpg|thumb|200px|Pisces in Hevelius' map (1690)]]

===Western folklore===
The Fishes are also associated with the German legend of [[Antenteh]], who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met a magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife begged him to return to the fish and ask for a beautiful furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with the tub and cabin once again. The tub in the story is sometimes recognized as the [[Great Square of Pegasus]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=45–47}}

=== In non-Western astronomy ===
The stars of Pisces were incorporated into several constellations in [[Chinese astronomy]]. Wai-ping (&quot;Outer Enclosure&quot;) was a fence that kept a pig farmer from falling into the marshes and kept the pigs where they belonged. It was represented by Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Mu, Nu, and Xi Piscium. The marshes were represented by the four stars designated Phi Ceti. The northern fish of Pisces was a part of the House of the Sandal, Koui-siou.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=45–47}}

=== Astrology ===

{{main|Pisces (astrology)}}
While the ''astrological sign'' Pisces per definition runs from ecliptical longitude 330° to 0, this position is now mostly covered by the constellation of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], due to the [[Stellar precession|precession]] from when the constellation and the sign coincided.

'''Draco''' is a [[constellation]] in the far northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dragon]]. Draco is [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] (that is, never setting) for many observers in the [[northern hemisphere]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. The north pole of the [[ecliptic]] is in Draco.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}

{{main|List of stars in Draco}}

[[Thuban]] (α Draconis) was the northern [[pole star]] from 3942 BC, when it moved farther north than Theta Boötis, until 1793 BC. The [[Egyptian Pyramids]] were designed to have one side facing north, with an entrance passage designed so that Thuban would be visible at night.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=239–240}} Due to the effects of [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession]], it will once again be the pole star around the year 21000 AD.&lt;!-- not cited to Ridpath &amp; Tirion 2001 --&gt; It is a blue-white giant star of magnitude 3.7, 309 light-years from Earth. The traditional name of Alpha Draconis, Thuban, means &quot;head of the serpent&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}

There are two other stars above magnitude 3 in Draco. The brighter of the two&amp;mdash;and the brightest star in Draco&amp;mdash;is [[Gamma Draconis]], traditionally called Etamin or Eltanin. It is an orange giant star of magnitude 2.2, 148 light-years from Earth. The [[aberration of starlight]] was discovered in 1728 when [[James Bradley]] observed Gamma Draconis. [[Beta Draconis]], traditionally called Rastaban, is a yellow giant star of magnitude 2.8, 362 light-years from Earth. Its name shares a meaning with Thuban, &quot;head of the serpent&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}

Draco is home to several double stars and binary stars. [[Eta Draconis|η Draconis]] is a [[double star]] with a yellow-hued primary of magnitude 2.8 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.2 located south of the primary. The two are separated by 4.8 [[arcsecond]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; [[Mu Draconis]], traditionally called Alrakis, is a [[binary star]] with two white components. Magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, the two components orbit each other every 670 years. The Alrakis system is 88 light-years from Earth. [[Nu Draconis]] is a similar binary star with two white components, 100 light-years from Earth. Both components are of magnitude 4.9 and can be distinguished in a small amateur telescope or a pair of binoculars. [[Omicron Draconis]] is a double star divisible in small telescopes. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 4.6, 322 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 7.8. [[Psi Draconis]] is a binary star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes, 72 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-white star of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.8. [[16 Draconis]] and [[17 Draconis]] are part of a triple star 400 light-years from Earth, divisible in medium-sized amateur telescopes. The primary, a blue-white star of magnitude 5.1, is itself a binary with components of magnitude 5.4 and 6.5. The secondary is of magnitude 5.5 and the system is 400 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}} [[20 Draconis]] is a binary star with a white-hued primary of magnitude 7.1 and a yellow-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3 located east-northeast of the primary. The two are separated by 1.2 arcseconds at their maximum and have an orbital period of 420 years. As of 2012, the two components are approaching their maximum separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; [[39 Draconis]] is a triple star 188 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue star of magnitude 5.0, the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.4, and the tertiary is  a star of magnitude 8.0; the tertiary appears to be a close companion to the primary. [[40 Draconis]] and [[41 Draconis]] are a binary star divisible in small telescopes. The two orange dwarf stars are 170 light-years from Earth and are of magnitude 5.7 and 6.1.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}

[[R Draconis]] is a red [[Mira variable|Mira-type variable star]] with a period of about 8 months. Its average minimum magnitude is approximately 12.4, and its average maximum magnitude is approximately 7.6. It was discovered to be a variable star by [[Hans Geelmuyden]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacRobert&quot;/&gt;

The constellation contains the star recently named [[Kepler-10]] which has been confirmed to be orbited by [[Kepler-10b]], the smallest ever rocky Earth-sized planet detected outside of our solar system.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
One of the [[deep-sky object]]s in Draco is the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]] (NGC 6543), a [[planetary nebula]] approximately 3,000 light-years away that was discovered by English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; It is 9th magnitude and was named for its appearance in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], though it appears as a fuzzy blue-green disk in an amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}} NGC 6543 has a very complex shape due to gravitational interactions between the components of the [[multiple star]] at its center, the progenitor of the nebula approximately 1,000 years ago.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} It is located 9.6 [[arcminute]]s away from the [[north ecliptic pole]] to the west-northwest. It is also related to [[IC 4677]], a nebula that appears as a bar 1.8 arcminutes to the west of the Cat's Eye nebula. In long-term exposures, IC 4677 appears as a portion of a ring surrounding the planetary nebula.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt;

There are several faint [[galaxy|galaxies]] in Draco, one of which is the [[lenticular galaxy]] [[NGC 5866]], sometimes considered to be [[Messier Object 102]]. Another is the [[Draco Dwarf Galaxy]], one of the least luminous galaxies with an [[absolute magnitude]] of −8.6 and a diameter of only about 3,500 [[light year]]s, discovered by Albert G. Wilson of [[Lowell Observatory]] in 1954. Another dwarf galaxy found in this constellation is [[PGC 39058]]. [[File:PGC 39058.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[PGC 39058]], a dwarf galaxy found within the Draco constellation&amp;nbsp;– picture taken by ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA.]]

Draco also features several [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s. One such massive cluster is [[Abell 2218]], located at a distance of 3 billion light-years ([[redshift]] 0.171). It acts as a [[gravitational lensing|gravitational lens]] for even more distant background galaxies, allowing astronomers to study those galaxies as well as Abell 2218 itself; more specifically, the lensing effect allows astronomers to confirm the cluster's mass as determined by [[x-ray]] emissions. One of the most well-known [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]] is [[Arp 188]], also called the &quot;Tadpole Galaxy&quot;. Named for its appearance, which features a &quot;tail&quot; of stars 280,000 light-years long, the Tadpole Galaxy is at a distance of 420 million light-years (redshift 0.0314). The tail of stars drawn off the Tadpole Galaxy appears blue because the gravitational interaction disturbed [[nebula|clouds of gas]] and sparked [[star formation]].{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

[[Q1634+706]] is a [[quasar]] that holds the distinction of being the most distant object usually visible in an amateur telescope. At magnitude 14.4, it appears starlike, though it is at a distance of 12.9 billion light-years. The light of Q1634+706 has taken 8.6 billion years to reach Earth, a discrepancy attributable to the [[expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt;

=== Mythology ===

[[File:Dracourania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Draco coils around the north celestial pole, as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]

Dragons in Greek mythology that may have inspired the constellation's name include [[Dragons in Greek mythology|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the golden apples of the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Hesperides]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}} [[Hercules]] killed Ladon during his [[labors of Hercules|12 labors]]; he was tasked with stealing the golden apples. [[Hercules (constellation)|The constellation of Hercules]] is depicted near Draco.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}

In Greco- Roman legend, Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess [[Minerva]] and tossed into the sky upon his defeat. The dragon was one of the [[Gigantes]], who battled the Olympic gods for ten years. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold [[North Celestial Pole]] before it could right itself.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}

Sometimes, Draco is represented as the demon son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Typhon]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}

Traditional Arabic astronomy does not depict a dragon in modern-day Draco, which is called the [[Mother Camels]]. Instead, two [[hyena]]s, represented by [[Eta Draconis]] and [[Zeta Draconis]] are seen attacking a baby camel (a dim star near [[Beta Draconis]]), which is protected by four female camels, represented by [[Beta Draconis]], [[Gamma Draconis]], [[Nu Draconis]], and [[Xi Draconis]]. The nomads who own the camels are camped nearby, represented by a cooking tripod composed of [[Upsilon Draconis|Upsilon]], [[Tau Draconis|Tau]], and [[Sigma Draconis]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=239}} In some mythology, Draco the dragon constellation had one- hundred magnificent heads, and gourded the golden apple tree, and put in the sky as a constellation for his bravery at protecting the apples. There are more myths than that, but that is one of the most common ones.

=== Meteor showers ===
The [[February Eta Draconids]] are a meteor shower that was discovered on February 4, 2011. Observers noted six meteors with a common [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] in a short period. Its parent is a previously unknown [[long-period comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Namesakes ==

[[USS Draco (AK-79)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation. 

The main character in the 1996 film ''[[Dragonheart]]'' gets his name from this constellation. The film also reveals that Draco is actually a dragon heaven, where dragons go when they die if they have upheld the oath of an ancient dragon to guard mankind, with dragons otherwise fading into nothing upon their deaths. At the conclusion of the film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king that he had saved years ago.

The chess opening called the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the Sicilian Defense was also named after the constellation by Russian chess master [[Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky]]. 

[[J.K. Rowling]] named the character [[Draco Malfoy]] after the constellation in her [[Harry Potter (series)|''Harry Potter'' book series]].

The [[Beyblade]] Lightning L-Drago 100HF and its evolutions Meteo L-Drago LW105LF and L-Drago Destructor F:S are inspired by/based on the Draco constellation. They all feature three dragon heads chasing each other in a counter-clockwise motion, possibly referencing Ladon's multiple heads.

'''''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''''' is an [[1899 in literature|1899]] book by Richard Hinckley Allen that discusses the names of [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[History of the constellations|their histories]].

==Author==&lt;!--'Richard Hinckley Allen' redirects here--&gt;
Richard Hinckley Allen (1838, [[Buffalo, New York]] – 1908, [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]) was a gifted [[polymath]] and [[amateur]] [[natural history|naturalist]]; his wide range of interests caused his friends to nickname him &quot;the walking encyclopedia.&quot; His youthful ambition to pursue [[astronomy]] was thwarted by poor eyesight, and he became a moderately successful businessman instead. He continued in scientific pursuits as a [[hobby]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- The following is from the &quot;External links&quot; section of the former article about Allen: --&gt; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/home.html Richard Hinckley Allen: Star Names — Their Lore and Meaning]. A brief on-line biography can be found [http://www.fillingthesky.com/Docs/PDF/RHAllen/rhallenbio.pdf here]. Another summary [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Stellarvue/message/4134  here].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
First published in 1899 as ''Star-Names and Their Meanings'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star-Names and Their Meanings'' (New York: G.E.&amp;nbsp;Stechert, 1899) [https://archive.org/details/starnamesandthe00allegoog Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; this work collected the origins of the names of stars and [[constellation]]s from a panoply of sources, some primary but most secondary; also telling briefly the various myths and folklore connected with stars in the Greco-Roman tradition; as well as in the Arabic, Babylonian, Indian and Chinese traditions, for which, however, some modern criticism having taken it to task, claiming it to be largely superseded.

The book also provides some cursory details about [[astronomy]] as the knowledge level of the end of the 19th century. Similarly, [[astrology]] and its history are dealt with briefly in the introduction, and some other basic astrological references are scattered throughout the book, although downplayed.

==Reception==
The book has been criticized by Paul Kunitzsch&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kunitzsch, (1979):[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979QJRAS..20..478K &quot;A Note on Star Names, especially Arabic, and their Literature&quot;], ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 20, pp. 478-480.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Gary D. Thompson for using obsolete sources, and thereby being unreliable on star names and their derivation. Thompson maintains that the discussion on star names is especially unreliable as regards to Arabic star names, and otherwise also to Mesopotamian, and Egyptian constellations and star names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary%2DDavid%2DThompson/page11-36.html Richard Allen's  Star-Names: Their Lore and Meaning] by [http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary%2DDavid%2DThompson/index1.html Gary D. Thompson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==
There is no direct modern equivalent, although [[Ian Ridpath]] deals with traditional Greek and Roman constellation mythology,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath, (1988): ''[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/contents.htm Star Tales]'', Cambridge, Lutterworth Press, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Short Guide to Modern Star Names'' by Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart (Otto Harrassowitz, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted as ''A Dictionary of Modern Star Names'', by Sky Publishing in 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; is an authoritative source on the origin of star names.

'''Libra''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|b|r|ə}} is a [[constellation]] of the [[zodiac]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[weighing scales]], and its symbol is [[Image:Libra.svg|20px]] ([[Unicode]] {{unicode|♎}}). It is fairly faint, with no [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] [[star]]s, and lies between [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the west and [[Scorpius]] to the east.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Libra}}
[[Image:LibraCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Libra as it can be seen with the naked eye. [http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/libra.html AlltheSky.com]]]

The brightest stars in Libra form a [[quadrilateral|quadrangle]] that distinguishes it for the unaided observer. [[Alpha Librae]], called Zubenelgenubi, is a [[binary star]] divisible in binoculars, 77 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.2. Its traditional name means &quot;the southern claw&quot;. Zubeneschamali ([[Beta Librae]]) is the corresponding &quot;northern claw&quot; to Zubenelgenubi. The brightest star in Libra, it is a green-tinged star of magnitude 2.6, 160 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Librae]] is called Zubenelakrab, which means &quot;the scorpion's claw&quot;, completing the suite of names referring to Libra's archaic status. It is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 3.9, 152 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

Libra is home to several other binary and double stars. [[Iota Librae]] is a complex multiple star, 377 light-years from Earth, with both optical and true binary components. The primary appears as a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5; it is a binary star indivisible in even the largest amateur instruments with a period of 23 years. The secondary, visible in small telescopes as a star of magnitude 9.4, is a binary with two components, magnitudes 10 and 11. There is an optical companion to Iota Librae; [[25 Librae]] is a star of magnitude 6.1, 219 light-years from Earth and visible in binoculars. [[Mu Librae]] is a binary star divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, 235 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.8.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

There are many [[variable star]]s in Libra as well. [[Delta Librae]] is an [[Algol variable|Algol-type]] [[eclipsing variable]] star, 304 lightyears from Earth. It has a period of 2 days, 8 hours; its minimum magnitude of 5.9 and its maximum magnitude is 4.9. [[FX Librae]], designated [[48 Librae]], is a [[shell star]] of magnitude 4.9. Shell stars, like [[Pleione (star)|Pleione]] and [[Gamma Cassiopeiae]], are [[blue supergiant]]s with irregular variations caused by their abnormally high speed of rotation. This ejects gas from the star's equator.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

σ Librae was formerly known as γ Scorpii despite being well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not redesignated as σ Librae until 1851 (by [[Benjamin A. Gould]]).

===Deep-sky objects===
Libra is home to one bright [[globular cluster]], [[NGC 5897]]. It is a loose cluster, 40,000 light-years from Earth; it is fairly large and has an integrated magnitude of 9.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

===Planetary systems===
Libra is home to the star [[Gliese 581]], which has a [[planetary system]] consisting of at least 6 planets. Both [[Gliese 581 d]],  and [[Gliese 581 g]] are debatably the most promising candidates for life, although Gliese 581 g's existences has been disputed and has not been entirely confirmed or agreed on in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiga |first=David |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19519-found-first-rocky-exoplanet-that-could-host-life.html |title=Found: first rocky exoplanet that could host life |publisher=[[NewScientist]]|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gliese 581 c]] is considered to be the first Earth-like [[extrasolar planet]] to be found within its parent star's [[habitable zone]].

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Libra.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Libra as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]

Libra was known in [[Babylonian astronomy]] as ''MUL Zibanu'' (the &quot;scales&quot; or &quot;balance&quot;), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion. The scales were held sacred to the sun god [[Shamash]], who was also the patron of truth and justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as the Scorpion's Claws in [[ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}} Since these times, Libra has been associated with law, fairness and civility. In Arabic ''zubānā'' means &quot;scorpion's claws&quot;, and likely similarly in other Semitic languages: this resemblance of words may be why the Scorpion's claws became the Scales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It has also been suggested that the scales are an allusion to the fact that when the sun entered this part of the [[ecliptic]] at the [[autumnal equinox]], the days and nights are equal.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Libra's status as the location of the equinox earned the equinox the name &quot;First Point of Libra&quot;, though its position ended in 730 because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen, A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 64 (2007, ISBN 978-1-931559-38-6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Libra is a constellation not mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] or [[Aratus]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In [[Roman mythology]], Libra is considered to depict the scales held by [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] (identified as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]), the goddess of justice. Libra is mentioned by [[Manetho]] (3rd century B.C.) and [[Geminus]] (1st century B.C.), and included by [[Ptolemy]] in his 48 [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s. Ptolemy catalogued 17 stars, [[Tycho Brahe]] 10, and [[Johannes Hevelius]] 20.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Libra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only became a constellation in [[ancient Rome]], when it began to represent the scales held by [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], associated with [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

Libra is the only zodiac sign that does not symbolize a living creature.

==Astrology==
{{Main|Libra (astrology)}}
{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Libra from October 31 to November 22. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] from September 23 to October 22, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from October 16 to November 15.

==Visualizations==

Traditionally, α and β Librae are considered to represent the scales' balance beam, and γ and σ are the weighing pans.

[[H.A. Rey]] has suggested a way to connect the stars more fully to graphically show a [[weighing scale|balance]]. [[Beta Librae]] represents the top of the balance, [[Gamma Librae]] and [[Alpha Librae]] represent the balance beam. [[Upsilon Librae]] and [[Tau Librae]] represent the left plate of the balance, while [[Sigma Librae]] represents the right plate.  All these  stars are of the third magnitude.

==Namesakes==
[[USS Libra (AKA-12)]] was a [[United States]] navy ship named after the constellation.

[[Image:Hydra constellation map.svg|thumb|250px|[[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] is the largest constellation.]]
The table below ranks the 88 modern [[constellation]]s by the [[solid angle]] that they subtend in the sky, measured in [[square degree]]s and [[Steradian#SI multiples|millisteradians]].

These solid angles depend on arbitrary boundaries between the constellations: the list below is based on constellation boundaries drawn up by [[Eugène Delporte]] in 1930 on behalf of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] and published in ''Délimitation scientifique des constellations'' (Cambridge University Press). Before Delporte's work, there was no precise list of the boundaries of each constellation.

Delporte drew the boundaries along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]; however, he did so for the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which means that due to [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map (e.g., for epoch [[J2000]]) are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.  This skew will increase over the years and centuries to come.  However, this does not change the solid angle of any constellation.

'''Tucana''' is a [[constellation]] of stars in the [[southern sky]], named after the [[toucan]], a [[South America]]n [[bird]]. It is one of twelve constellations conceived in the late sixteenth century by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. Tucana first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]] and was depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603. French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] gave its stars [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. The constellations Tucana, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]], [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

Tucana is not a prominent constellation as all of [[List of stars in Tucana|its stars]] are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is [[Alpha Tucanae]] with an [[apparent magnitude|apparent visual magnitude]] of 2.87. [[Beta Tucanae]] is a star system with six member stars, while [[Kappa Tucanae|Kappa]] is a quadruple system. Five star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet]]s to date. The constellation contains [[47 Tucanae]], one of the brightest [[globular cluster]]s in the sky, and most of the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]].

Tucana is one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a [[celestial atlas]] was in the German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603. Both Plancius and Bayer depict it as a [[toucan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart|work=Star Tales|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt;&lt;ref name=jasc45_215/&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name ''Den Indiaenschen Exster, op Indies Lang ghenaemt''  &quot;the Indian magpie, named Lang in the Indies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published|work=Star Tales  | accessdate= 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by this meaning a particular bird with a long beak—a [[hornbill]], a bird native to the East Indies.

==Characteristics==
Irregular in shape, Tucana is bordered by [[Hydrus]] to the east, Grus and Phoenix to the north, [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] to the west and [[Octans]] to the south. Covering 295 square degrees, it ranks 48th of the 88 constellations in size. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Tuc'.&lt;ref name=pa30_469/&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|22|08.45}} and {{RA|01|24.82}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −56.31° and −75.35°.&lt;ref name=boundary/&gt; As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the 30th parallel in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and is [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] at latitudes south of the 50th parallel in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Motz|first=Lloyd|coauthors=Nathanson, Carol|title=The Constellations: An Enthusiast's Guide to the Night Sky|publisher=Aurum Press|location=London, United Kingdom|year=1991|pages=385, 389|isbn=978-1-85410-088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he depicted Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars [[Bayer designation]]s. French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair of stars close together Lambda Tucanae, and a group of three stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American astronomer [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]] designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, and it is now known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by [[Francis Baily]], who felt the star was too faint to warrant a designation, and Kappa's two components came to be known as Kappa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Kappa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagman&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, [[Virginia|VA]]  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=305–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt;

[[Beta Tucanae|Beta]], [[Delta Tucanae|Delta]] and [[Kappa Tucanae|Kappa]] are multiple [[star system]]s containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near the tail of the toucan,&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;/&gt; Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Beta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are separated by an angle of 27 [[arcsecond]]s and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively.

[[File:The Globular Cluster 47 Tu.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Globular Cluster 47 Tucana|Globular Cluster 47 Tuc. Credit [[ESO]]]]
The second-brightest [[globular cluster]] in the sky after [[Omega Centauri]], [[47 Tucanae]] (NGC 104) lies just west of the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 billion years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;o'meara&quot;/&gt; Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of [[blue stragglers]], hot stars that are hypothesized to form from [[binary star merger]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Nearby globular clusters are the diminutive [[NGC 121]], 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster's edge, and [[Lindsay 8]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=163–164}}

[[NGC 362]] is another globular cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster and among the brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it very close to the center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by [[James Dunlop]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=165}} Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.&lt;ref name=&quot;striecher 2005&quot;/&gt;

Located at the southern end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a [[dwarf galaxy]] that is one of the nearest neighbors to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, [[tidal forces]] from the Milky Way have distorted it.

'''Ophiuchus''' {{IPAc-en|ɒ|f|i|ˈ|juː|k|ə|s}} is a large [[constellation]] located around the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ὀφιοῦχος}} &quot;[[snake|serpent]]-bearer&quot;, and it is commonly represented as a man grasping the snake that is represented by the constellation [[Serpens]]. Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It was formerly referred to as '''Serpentarius''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɜr|p|ən|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|s}} and ''Anguitenens''.

==Location==
Ophiuchus is located between [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Serpens]] and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], northwest of the center of the [[Milky Way]]. The southern part lies between [[Scorpius]] to the west and [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the east. In the [[northern hemisphere]], it is best visible in summer. It is located opposite [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the sky. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a [[Serpens|serpent]]; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, [[Serpens Caput]] and [[Serpens Cauda]], which are nonetheless counted as one constellation.

Ophiuchus straddles the equator but lies predominately to its north. Rasalhague, a fairly conspicuous star in its north, is circumpolar north of 78° north latitude and invisible south of 78° south latitude. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination, so the constellation can never be seen in full even in such places as [[Anchorage]], [[Reykjavík]], and [[Helsinki]] north of 60° north latitude. Segments of the ecliptic that lie within Ophiuchus lie south of −20° declination and are thus invisible north of 70° north latitude.

In contrast to Orion, it is in the period November–January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere) when Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However for much of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the South. In the Northern Hemisphere's summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible in the Arctic Circle because the sun does not set at that time of year north of the Arctic Circle.
In countries close to the equator Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Ophiuchus}}
The brightest stars in Ophiuchus include [[Alpha Ophiuchi|α Ophiuchi]], called Ras Alhague (&quot;head of the serpent charmer&quot;), at magnitude 2.07, and [[Eta Ophiuchi|η Ophiuchi]], known as Sabik (&quot;the preceding one&quot;), at magnitude 2.43.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 170 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt; Other bright stars in the constellation include [[Beta Ophiuchi|β Ophiuchi]], Cebalrai (&quot;heart of the shepherd&quot;) and [[Lambda Ophiuchi|λ Ophiuchi]], or Marfik (&quot;the elbow&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, at p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RS Ophiuchi]] is part of a class called recurrent [[nova]]e, whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days. It is thought to be at the brink of becoming a type-1a [[supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5204676.stm Star 'soon to become supernova']. [[BBC News]], 23 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Removing link to http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7100/full/nature04893.html as you have to be a paying customer to use it. --&gt;

[[Barnard's Star]], one of the [[list of nearest stars|nearest stars]] to the [[Solar System]] (the only stars closer are the [[Alpha Centauri]] [[binary star]] system and [[Proxima Centauri]]), lies in Ophiuchus. It is located to the left of β and just north of the V-shaped group of stars in an area that was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation of [[Taurus Poniatovii]] (Poniatowski's Bull).

In 2005, astronomers using data from the [[Green Bank Telescope]] discovered a [[superbubble]] so large that it extends beyond the plane of the galaxy.&lt;ref name='huge superbubble'&gt;{{cite news | title=Huge 'Superbubble' of Gas Blowing Out of Milky Way | date=13 January 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.physorg.com/news9882.html | work =[[PhysOrg.com]] | accessdate = 4 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the [[Ophiuchus Superbubble]].

In April 2007, [[astronomy|astronomers]] announced that the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-built [[Odin (satellite)|Odin satellite]] had made the first detection of clouds of [[molecule|molecular]] [[oxygen]] in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417080835.htm|title=Molecular Oxygen Detected For The First Time In The Interstellar Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SN 1604|supernova of 1604]] was first observed on 9 October 1604, near θ Ophiuchi. [[Johannes Kepler]] saw it first on 16 October and studied it so extensively that the [[supernova]] was subsequently called Kepler's Supernova. He published his findings in a book titled ''De stella nova in pede Serpentarii'' (On the New Star in Ophiuchus' Foot). [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] used its brief appearance to counter the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[dogma]] that the heavens are changeless.

In 2009 it was announced that [[GJ 1214]], a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5 days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7275/full/nature08679.html Charbonneau et al. &quot;A super-Earth transiting a nearby low-mass star&quot; Nature 462, 891-894 (17 December 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; The planet's low density (about 40% that of Earth) suggests that the planet may have a substantial component of low-density gas—possibly [[hydrogen]] or [[steam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716.1208R Rogers &amp; Seager. &quot;Three Possible Origins for the Gas Layer on GJ 1214b&quot; Astrophysical Journal 716, 1208-1216 (June 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The proximity of this star to Earth (42 light years) makes it a tempting target for further observations.

In April 2010, the naked-eye star [[Zeta Ophiuchi|ζ Ophiuchi]] was occulted by [[824 Anastasia]].

===Deep-sky objects===
Ophiuchus contains several [[star cluster]]s, such as [[Open Cluster IC 4665|IC 4665]], [[NGC 6633]], [[Globular Cluster M9|M9]], [[Globular Cluster M10|M10]], [[Globular Cluster M12|M12]], [[Globular Cluster M14|M14]], [[Globular Cluster M19|M19]], [[Globular Cluster M62|M62]], and [[Globular Cluster M107|M107]], as well as the [[nebula]] IC 4603-4604.

[[Messier 10|M10]] is a fairly close [[globular cluster]], only 20,000 light-years from Earth. It has a magnitude of 6.6 and is a Shapley class VII cluster. This means that it has &quot;intermediate&quot; concentration; it is only somewhat concentrated towards its center.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=153-154}}

[[File:Rho Ophiucus Widefield - Reduced.jpg|thumb|right|Photo from Rogelio Bernal Andreo of the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex|Rho Ophiuchi]] [[molecular cloud]] complex.]]The unusual [[galaxy]] merger remnant and [[starburst galaxy]] [[NGC 6240]] is also in Ophiuchus. At a distance of 400 million light-years, this &quot;butterfly-shaped&quot; galaxy has two [[supermassive black hole]]s 3,000 light-years apart. Confirmation of the fact that both [[active galactic nucleus|nuclei]] contain black holes was obtained by [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Astronomers estimate that the black holes will [[binary black hole|merge]] in another billion years. NGC 6240 also has an unusually high rate of [[star formation]], classifying it as a [[starburst galaxy]]. This is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes and the aftermath of the [[galactic merger|collision]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a new nearby [[star cluster]] was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star [[Mu Ophiuchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Nearby Candidate Star Cluster in Ophiuchus at d = 170 pc|author=Mamajek, Eric E.|year=2006|journal=Astronomical
Journal|volume=132|issue=5|page=2198|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2198M|doi=10.1086/508205|arxiv = astro-ph/0609064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mamajek 2]] cluster appears to be a poor cluster remnant analogous to the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], but 7 times more distant (approximately 170 parsecs away). Mamajek 2 appears to have formed in the same star-forming complex as the [[NGC 2516]] cluster roughly 135 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dynamical Evolution and Spectral Characteristics of the Stellar Group Mamajek 2|author=Jilinski, E., Ortega, V.G., de la Reza, R., Drake, N.A., and Bazzanella, B.|year=2009|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=691|issue=1|page=212|bibcode=2009ApJ...691..212J|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/691/1/212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnard 68]] is a large [[dark nebula]], located 410 light-years from Earth. Despite its diameter of 0.4 light-years, Barnard 68 only has twice the mass of the Sun, making it both very diffuse and very cold - about 16 [[kelvin]]s. Though it is currently stable, Barnard 68 will eventually collapse, inciting the process of [[star formation]]. One unusual feature of Barnard 68 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000 years. Astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the [[shock wave]] from a [[supernova]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

==History and mythology==
[[File:Azophi Ophiuchus.jpg|thumb|Ophiuchus in a manuscript copy of [[Azophi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars|Uranometry]]'', 18th-century copy of a manuscript prepared for [[Ulugh Beg]] in 1417 (note that as in all pre-modern [[star chart]]s, the constellation is mirrored, with [[Serpens Caput]]  on the left and [[Serpens Cauda]] on the right).]]
[[Image:Ophiuchusurania.jpg|thumb|Ophiuchus holding the serpent, Serpens, as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825. Above the tail of the serpent is the now-obsolete constellation [[Taurus Poniatovii]] while below it is [[Scutum]].]]

There is no evidence of the constellation preceding the [[Classical Greece|classical era]], and in [[Babylonian astronomy]], a &quot;Sitting Gods&quot; constellation seems to have been located in the general area of Ophiuchus. However, Gavin White proposes that Ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this Babylonian constellation, representing [[Nirah (mythology)|Nirah]], a serpent-god who was sometimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 187f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mention of the constellation is in [[Aratus]], informed by the lost catalogue of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (4th century BC):&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' s.v. &quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29fiou%3Dxos ὀφιοῦχος]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
:To the Phantom's back the [[Corona|Crown]] is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus, and then from it you can trace the starlit Ophiuchus himself: so brightly set beneath his head appear his gleaming shoulders. They would be clear to mark even at the midmonth moon, but his hands are not at all so bright; for faint runs the gleam of stars along on this side and on that. Yet they too can be seen, for they are not feeble. Both firmly clutch the [[Serpens|Serpent]], which encircles the waist of Ophiuchus, but he, steadfast with both his feet well set, tramples a huge monster, even the [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]n, standing upright on his eye and breast. Now the Serpent is wreathed about his two hands – a little above his right hand, but in many folds high above his left.&lt;ref&gt;trans. Mair, A. W. &amp; G. R. Loeb Classical Library Volume 129. London: William Heinemann, 1921. [http://www.theoi.com/Text/AratusPhaenomena.html theoi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[ancient_greece|ancient Greeks]], the constellation represented the god [[Apollo]] struggling with a huge snake that guarded the [[Oracle of Delphi]].&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert|title=Illustrated Guide to Astronomical Wonders: From Novice to Master Observer|year=2007|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=9780596526856|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Later myths identified Ophiuchus with [[Laocoön]], the [[Trojan]] priest of [[Poseidon]], who warned his fellow Trojans about the [[Trojan Horse]] and was later slain by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods to punish him.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roman era]] mythography,&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 14 Latin Mythography, 2nd century AD&lt;/ref&gt; the figure represents the healer [[Asclepius]], who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming [[Immortality|immortal]] under Asclepius' care, [[Zeus]] killed him with a bolt of [[lightning]], but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works.

In medieval [[Islamic astronomy]] ([[Azophi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars|Uranometry]]'', 10th century), the constellation was known as ''Al-Ḥawwaʾ'' &quot;the snake-charmer&quot;.

[[Aratus]] describes Ophiuchus as trampling on [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] with his feet. This is depicted in Renaissance to Early Modern [[star chart]]s, beginning with [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515; in some depictions (such as that of [[Johannes Kepler]], 1604), Scorpio also seems to threaten to sting Serpentarius in the foot.
This is consistent with [[Azophi]], who already included [[Psi Ophiuchi|ψ Oph]] and [[Omega Ophiuchi|ω Oph]] as the snake-charmer's &quot;left foot&quot;, and [[Theta Ophiuchi|θ Oph]] and [[Omicron Ophiuchi|ο Oph]] as his &quot;right foot&quot;, making Ophiuchus a [[zodiacal constellation]] at least as regards his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icoproject.org/img/ss59.jpg Manuscript reproduction] at [http://www.icoproject.org/cons.html icoproject.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
This arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature, and placed in relation to the words spoken by God to the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] (Genesis 3:15).&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Walter Maunder]], ''Astronomy of the Bible'' (1908), p. 164f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
[[John Milton]] used Opiuchus as the vehicle for an epic simile in Book 2 of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', comparing Satan to a comet burning across the length of Opiuchus (lines 706-10): 'on th' other side / Incensed with indignation Satan stood / Unterrified, and like a comet burned / That fires the length of Opiuchus huge / In th' arctic sky'.

==Ophiuchus and the zodiac==
{{main|Ophiuchus (astrology)}}
Ophiuchus is one of thirteen constellations that cross the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee T. Shapiro, [http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder3/ &quot;Constellations in the zodiac&quot;], in ''The Space Place'' (NASA, last updated 22 July 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has therefore been called the '13th sign of the zodiac'. However, this confuses [[Astrological sign|sign]] with [[constellation]].

The ''signs'' of the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with the seasons so that the [[March equinox]] falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries.

''Constellations'', on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars. The [[Zodiacal constellation#Zodiacal constellations|constellations of the zodiac]] have only a loose association with the signs of the zodiac, and do not in general coincide with them. In Western astrology the constellation of Aquarius, for example, largely corresponds to the sign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation of Ophiuchus occupies most of the sign of Sagittarius. The differences are due to the fact that the time of year that the sun passes through a particular zodiac constellation's position has slowly changed over the centuries from when the Greeks and Babylonians originally developed the Zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aitken|first=R. G.|title=Edmund Halley and Stellar Proper Motions|journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets|date=October 1942|volume=4,|issue=164|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1942ASPL....4..103A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redd|first=Nola Taylor|title=Constellations: The Zodiac Constellation Names|url=http://www.space.com/15722-constellations.html|publisher=space.com|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is due to the Earth's [[axial precession]].

'''Ara''' is a southern [[constellation]] situated between [[Scorpius]] and [[Triangulum Australe]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[altar]]&quot;. Ara was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of [[Scorpius]] and thus has rich star fields.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

* '''[[Alpha Arae|α Ara]]''' is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 242 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Beta Arae|β Ara]]''' is an orange-hued supergiant of magnitude 2.8, 600 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Gamma Arae|γ Ara]]''' is a blue-hued supergiant of magnitude 3.3, 1140 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Delta Arae|δ Ara]]''' is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 3.6, 187 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Zeta Arae|ζ Ara]]''' is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 3.1, 574 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

The constellation's stars have no names in [[Western culture]], but the [[Culture of China|Chinese]] call [[Alpha Arae|α Arae]] &quot;Choo&quot; (&quot;club&quot; or &quot;staff&quot;), and [[Epsilon Arae|ε Arae]] &quot;Tso Kang&quot;, meaning 'left guard'.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s (notably [[NGC 6200]]) and [[diffuse nebula]]e (including the bright cluster/nebula pair [[NGC 6188]] and [[NGC 6193]]). The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, sixth magnitude [[NGC 6397]], lies at a distance of just {{convert|6500|ly|km}}, making it one of the closest globular cluster to the [[solar system]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two [[spiral galaxies]] (NGC 6215 and NGC 6221) are visible near star [[Eta Arae|η Arae]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

==== Open clusters ====

* [[NGC 6193]] is an [[open cluster]] containing approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about half the size of the [[full Moon]]. It is approximately 4200 light-years from Earth. It has one bright member, a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.9. NGC 6193 is surrounded by [[NGC 6188]], a faint [[nebula]] only normally visible in [[astrophotography|long-exposure photographs]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

* [[NGC 6200]]
* NGC 6204
* NGC 6208
* NGC 6250
* NGC 6253
* IC 4651

==== Globular clusters ====

* NGC 6352
* [[NGC 6362]]
* [[NGC 6397]] is a [[globular cluster]] with an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally dark skies and is normally visible in binoculars. It is a fairly close globular cluster, at a distance of 10,500 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

===Planetary Nebulae===

The [[Stingray Nebula]] (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.

Last, but not least; there is also [[NGC 6326]].  A planetary nebula that might have a binary system at its center.

== Illustrations ==

[[File:Ara Bode.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Elert Bode]]'s illustration of Ara, from his ''Uranographia'' (1801)]]
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an [[altar]] with its smoke 'rising' southward.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Ara}} However, depictions of Ara often vary in their details. In the early days of printing, a 1482 [[woodcut]] of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]'s classic ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' depicts the altar as surrounded by demons.&lt;ref name=Kanas&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=History, Artistry, and Cartography (Second Edition)|year=2012|publisher=Praxis Publishing|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|page=136|url=http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0917-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense; the flames rise southward as in most atlases. [[Hyginus]] also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, [[Willem Blaeu]], a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering. Unlike most depictions, the smoke from Blaeu's Ara rises northward, represented by [[Alpha Arae]]. A more unusual depiction of Ara comes from [[Aratus]], a Greek uranographer, in 270 BCE. He drew Ara as a lighthouse, where Alpha. [[Beta Arae|Beta]], [[Epsilon Arae|Epsilon]], and [[Zeta Arae]] represent the base, and [[Eta Arae]] represents the flames at the lighthouse's light.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=230}}

== Mythology ==

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} The nearby [[Milky Way]] represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=229}}

== Equivalents ==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of the constellation Ara lie within ''[[Azure Dragon|The Azure Dragon of the East]]'' (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}}

== Namesakes ==

[[USS Ara (AK-136)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

'''Cassiopeia''' is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, named after the vain queen [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]] in [[Greek mythology]], who boasted about her unrivalled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars. It is bordered by [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] to the south, [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] to the southeast, and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] to the north. It is opposite the [[Big Dipper]], and from northern latitudes can be seen at its clearest in early November.

==Notable features==
[[File:CassiopeiaCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Cassiopeia as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Cassiopeia (image right side up).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cassiopeia in her chair, as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825.]]

The four brightest stars of Cassiopeia are all brighter than the third magnitude. 
* [[Alpha Cassiopeiae]], traditionally called ''Shedir'' (from the Arabic ''Al Sadr'', &quot;the breast&quot;), is a [[double star]]. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 2.2, 229 light-years from Earth. The secondary is widely separated from the primary and is of magnitude 8.9. Its traditional name means &quot;the breast&quot;. 
* [[Beta Cassiopeiae]], or ''Caph'' (meaning &quot;hand&quot;), is a white-hued star of magnitude 2.3, 54 light-years from Earth. 16th-century Arabian astronomer [[Al Tizini]] gave this star the name ''Al Sanam al Nakah'', (The Camel's Hump), referring to the contemporaneous Persian figure.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1889) Star Names, p. 146 ((see also http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Caph.html).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The two other notably bright stars in Cassiopeia are both variable stars. [[Gamma Cassiopeiae]] is a [[shell star]], a type of variable star that has a very high rate of rotation. This causes the star to be somewhat unstable and periodically eject rings of material. Gamma Cassiopeiae has a minimum magnitude of 3.0 and  a maximum magnitude of 1.6; it is currently approximately magnitude 2.2. [[Delta Cassiopeiae]], also known as &quot;Ruchbah&quot; or &quot;Rukbat,&quot; meaning &quot;knee,&quot; is a [[Algol]]-type [[eclipsing variable]] star. It varies by 0.1 magnitudes around magnitude 2.7; its period is 2 years and 1 month. Ruchbah appears to have a blue-white hue and it is 99 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}}

There are several dimmer single stars in Cassiopeia. [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 3.3, 442 light-years from Earth. [[Rho Cassiopeiae]] is a [[semi-regular pulsating variable]] yellow-hued supergiant star, among the most luminous stars in the galaxy with a luminosity of approximately 500,000 [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]]. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum magnitude of 4.1; its period is approximately 320 days. Rho Cassiopeiae is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}}

Cassiopeia possesses several dimmer [[double stars]] and [[binary stars]]. [[Eta Cassiopeiae]] is a binary star with a period of 480 years. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5 and the secondary is a red-hued star of magnitude 7.5. The system is 19 light-years from Earth. [[Iota Cassiopeiae]] is a [[triple star]] 142 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.5, the secondary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.9, and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 8.4. The primary and secondary are close together but the primary and tertiary are widely separated. [[Sigma Cassiopeiae]] is a binary star 1500 light-years from Earth. It has a green-hued primary of magnitude 5.0 and a blue-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3.  [[Psi Cassiopeiae]] is a triple star 193 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.7 and the secondary is a close pair of stars that appears to be of magnitude 9.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}}

===Deep-sky objects===

[[File:Sun from Alpha Centauri.png|left|thumb|160px|The [[Sun]] would appear close to Cassiopeia from [[Alpha Centauri]]]]

Because it lies in rich [[Milky Way]] star fields, Cassiopeia contains many deep sky objects, including [[open cluster]]s and [[nebula]]e.

Two [[Messier objects]], [[Messier 52|M52]] (NGC 7654) and [[Messier 103|M103]] (NGC 581), are located in Cassiopeia; both are open clusters. M52, once described as a &quot;kidney-shaped&quot; cluster, contains approximately 100 stars and is 5200 light-years from Earth. Its most prominent member is an orange-hued star of magnitude 8.0 near the cluster's edge. M103 is far poorer than M52, with only about 25 stars included. It is also more distant, at 8200 light-years from Earth. Its most prominent member is actually a closer, superimposed double star; it consists of a 7th-magnitude primary and 10th-magnitude secondary.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}}

The other prominent open clusters in Cassiopeia are [[NGC 457]] and [[NGC 663]], both of which have about 80 stars. NGC 457 is looser, and its brightest member is [[Phi Cassiopeiae]], a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 5.0. The stars of NGC 457, arrayed in chains, are approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth. NGC 663 is both closer, at 8200 light-years from Earth, and larger, at 0.25 degrees in diameter.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}}

[[File:Potw1327a.tif|thumb|left|Planetary nebula [[IC 289]] is a cloud of ionised gas being pushed out into space by the remnants of the star’s core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stars that go out with a whimper|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1327a/|accessdate=21 July 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

There are two [[supernova remnant]]s in Cassiopeia. The first, which is unnamed, is the aftermath of the supernova called [[Tycho's Star]]. It was observed in 1572 by [[Tycho Brahe]] and now exists as a bright object in the [[radio spectrum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=106-108}} Within the 'W' asterism formed by Cassiopeia’s five major stars lies [[Cassiopeia A]] (Cas A). It is the remnant of a [[supernova]] that took place approximately 300 years ago (as observed now from Earth; it is 10,000 light-years away),&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the distinction of being the strongest radio source observable outside our solar system. It was perhaps observed as a faint star in 1680 by [[John Flamsteed]]. It was also the subject of the first image returned by the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] in the late 1990s. The shell of matter expelled from the star is moving at {{convert|4000|km|mi}} per second; it has a temperature of 30,000 kelvin on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Cassiopeia from Wrightsville.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|Cassiopeia photographed from Wrightsville Beach, NC by Zach Rudisin.]]

[[NGC 457]] is another open cluster in Cassiopeia, also called the [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]] Cluster, the Owl Cluster, and [[Caldwell catalogue|Caldwell]] 13. The cluster was discovered in 1787 by [[William Herschel]]. It has an overall magnitude of 6.4 and is approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth, lying in the [[Perseus arm]] of the [[Milky Way]]. However, its most prominent member, the [[double star]] [[Phi Cassiopeiae]], is far closer - between 1000 and 4000 light-years away. NGC 457 is fairly rich; it is a [[Shapley class]] e and [[Trumpler class]] I 3 r cluster. It is concentrated towards its center and detached from the star field. It contains more than 100 stars, which vary widely in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=92-93}}

Two members of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies are in Cassiopeia. [[NGC 185]] is a magnitude 9.2 [[elliptical galaxy]] of type E0, 2 million light-years away. Slightly dimmer and more distant [[NGC 147]] is a magnitude 9.3 elliptical galaxy, like NGC 185 it is an elliptical of type E0; it is 2.3 million light-years from Earth. Though they do not appear in [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], both [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] are gravitationally bound to the far larger [[Andromeda Galaxy]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=180-181}}

===Pattern from Alpha Centauri===
If one were able to observe Earth's [[Sun]] from [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star to our [[solar system]], it would appear in Cassiopeia as a yellow-white 0.5 magnitude star. The famous W of Cassiopeia would become a zig-zag pattern with the Sun at the leftmost end, closest to [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|ε Cas]].

===Meteor showers===
The [[December Phi Cassiopeiids]] are a recently discovered early December [[meteor shower]] that [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiates]] from Cassiopeia. Phi Cassiopeiids are very slow, with an entry velocity of approximately 16.7 kilometers per second. The shower's parent body is a [[Jupiter family comet]], though its specific identity is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 25 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{main|Cassiopeia (mythology)}}
The constellation is named after Cassiopeia, the queen of [[Aethiopia]]. Cassiopeia was the wife of [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia]] and mother of Princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed next to each other among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment for her boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the [[Nereid]]s or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen, A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 82 (2007, ISBN 978-1-931559-38-6).&lt;/ref&gt;  As punishment, she was forced to wheel around the [[North Celestial Pole]] on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and [[Poseidon]] decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster [[Cetus]], who was ravishing the Ethiopian coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chen&quot;&gt;{{P.K.|Chen|2007|pp=82-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassiopeia has been variously portrayed throughout her history as a constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by [[al-Sufi]] as a queen holding a staff with a [[Hilal (crescent moon)|crescent moon]] in her right hand, wearing a crown, as well as a two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding her robe in her right hand. This depiction is from [[Augustin Royer]]'s 1679 atlas.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

In the ancient Celtic world Anu was the mother goddess and considered to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is another word for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and considered to be the ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks down on us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.

==In non-Western astronomy==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars forming the constellation Cassiopeia are found among three areas: the [[Purple Forbidden enclosure]] (紫微垣, ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán''), the [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ''), and the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'').

The Chinese astronomers saw several figures in what is modern-day Cassiopeia. Kappa, Eta, and Mu Cassopeiae formed a constellation called the Bridge of the Kings; when seen along with Alpha and Beta Cassiopeiae, they formed the great chariot ''Wang-Liang''. The charioteer's whip was represented by Gamma Cassiopeiae, sometimes called &quot;Tsih&quot;, the Chinese word for &quot;whip&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

In the 1600s, various [[Biblical figures]] were depicted in the stars of Cassiopeia. These included [[Bathsheba]], Solomon's mother; [[Deborah]], an Old Testament prophet; and [[Mary Magdalene]]. a disciple of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

A figure called the &quot;Tinted Hand&quot; also appeared in the stars of Cassiopeia in some Arab atlases. This is variously said to represent a woman's hand dyed red with [[henna]], as well as the bloodied hand of [[Muhammad]]'s daughter [[Fatima bint Muhammad|Fatima]]. The hand is made up of the stars [[Alpha Cassiopeiae|α Cas]], [[Beta Cassiopeiae|β Cas]], [[Gamma Cassiopeiae|γ Cas]], [[Delta Cassiopeiae|δ Cas]], [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|ε Cas]], and [[Eta Cassiopeiae|η Cas]]. The arm is made up of the stars [[Alpha Persei|α Per]], [[Gamma Persei|γ Per]], [[Delta Persei|δ Per]], [[Epsilon Persei|ε Per]], [[Eta Persei|η Per]], and [[Nu Persei|ν Per]].&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

Another Arab constellation that incorporated the stars of Cassiopeia was the Camel. Its head was composed of Lambda, Kappa, Iota, and Phi Andromedae; its hump was Beta Cassiopeiae; its body was the rest of Cassiopeia, and the legs were composed of stars in Perseus and Andromeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

Other cultures see a hand or moose antlers in the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ptak |first=Robert |title=Sky Stories Ancient and Modern |location=New York |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |year=1998 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[Lapps]], for whom the W of Cassiopeia forms an elk antler. The [[Chukchi people|Chukchee]] of [[Siberia]] similarly saw the five main stars as five reindeer stags.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

The people of the [[Marshall Islands]] saw Cassiopeia as part of a great porpoise constellation. The main stars of Cassiopeia make its tail, Andromeda and [[Triangulum]] form its body, and [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] makes its head.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt; In [[Hawaii]], Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Cassiopeiae were named. Alpha Cassiopeiae was called ''Poloahilani'', Beta Cassiopeiae was called ''Polula'', and Gamma Cassiopeiae was called ''Mulehu''. The people of [[Pukapuka]] saw the figure of Cassiopeia as a distinct constellation called ''Na Taki-tolu-a-Mataliki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==In Popular Culture==
In the 1997 film &quot;[[Contact (1997 US film)|Contact]]&quot; starring [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Matthew McConaughey]], Foster's character [[Doctor Arroway]] has the following line of dialogue: &quot;You see that large W-shaped constellation there? That's Cassiopeia. And Cassiopeia A gives off a whole lot of radio signals. I listen to them a lot. It's a remnant of a supernova.&quot;

In the 1998 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', &quot;[[Patient X (The X-Files)|Patient X]]&quot;, guest starring [[Veronica Cartwright]], Cartwright's character [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Cassandra_Spender|Cassandra Spender]], an alien abductee, leaves fingerprints on a window corresponding to the constellation Cassiopeia, a reference to the character's name (she is confined to a wheelchair) as well as an implied origin for the aliens who abducted her.

In the 2001 movie [[Serendipity (film)|Serendipity]], starring [[John Cusack]] and [[Kate Beckinsale]], Cusack tells Beckinsale about the constellation Cassiopeia the night they meet one another after noticing that the freckles on her forearm match the constellation's pattern exactly.

In [[Sara Bareilles]]' 2013 album &quot;The Blessed Unrest,&quot; the 7th track is titled Cassiopeia and is lyrically and metaphorically about the stars.

In the movie &quot;[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]],&quot; while [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]'s character John Coffey is being smuggled from prison, Coffey points at the sky at what appears to be Cassiopeia and says to Paul Edgecomb (played by [[Tom Hanks]]), &quot;Look boss! It's Cassie, the lady in the rockin' chair!&quot;

In the 2011 episode of The Big Bang Theory, &quot;The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,&quot; (Season 5, Episode 4), [[Raj Koothrappali|Rajesh &quot;Raj&quot; Koothrappali]] ([[Kunal Nayyar]]) is out on a date with a deaf woman named Emily (Katie Leclerc). Raj did not know American Sign Language, so [[Howard Wolowitz]] ([[Simon Helberg]]) assists Raj on the date by translating for him. Howard, however, is upset and bored by the end of the date, so he translates things differently than Raj says them. At one point, as the three were walking out of the restaurant, Raj points to the night sky and says, &quot;It's a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda, who's over there.&quot; Howard, after a moment, translates it, &quot;Look, pretty stars.&quot;

In the children's novel [[Momo]], by German author [[Michael Ende]], the heroine finds a turtle named Cassiopeia.

Cassiopeia is also the name of the fanclub for the Korean boy-band [[TVXQ]]. The five stars that make up the constellation represent the 5 members of the group.

==Namesakes==
[[USS Cassiopeia (AK-75)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.

[[File:Orion IAU.svg|320px|thumb|The constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is one of the most recognizable in the night sky.]]
[[File:OrionCC.jpg|320px|thumb|The constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as it can be seen by the naked eye. Lines have been added.]]
In modern [[astronomy]], a '''constellation''' is an internationally defined area of the [[celestial sphere]]. These areas are grouped around [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] (which themselves are generally referred to in non-technical language as &quot;constellations&quot;), which are patterns formed by prominent stars within apparent proximity to one another on Earth's [[night sky]]. When astronomers say an object is &quot;in&quot; a given constellation, they mean it is within the boundaries of one of these defined areas of sky.

There are also numerous [[former constellations|historical constellations]] not recognized by the IAU or constellations recognized in regional traditions of astronomy or [[astrology]], such as [[Chinese constellation|Chinese]], [[Indian astronomy|Hindu]] and [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|Australian Aboriginal]].

==Terminology==
The [[Late Latin]] term ''constellātiō'' can be translated as &quot;set with stars&quot;.
The term was first used in [[astrology]], of asterisms that supposedly exerted influence, attested in [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (4th century).
In [[Middle English|English]] the term was used from the 14th century, also in astrology, of conjunctions of [[planet (astrology)|planets]].
The modern astronomical sense of &quot;area of the celestial sphere around a specific asterism&quot; dates to the mid 16th century.

Colloquial usage does not distinguish the senses of &quot;asterism&quot; and &quot;area surrounding an asterism&quot;. The modern system of constellations used in astronomy focuses primarily on constellations as grid-like segments of the celestial sphere rather than as patterns, while the term for a star-pattern is [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. For example, the asterism known as the [[Big Dipper]] corresponds to the seven brightest stars of the larger IAU constellation of [[Ursa Major]].

The term [[circumpolar constellation]] is used for any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon. From the [[north pole]], all constellations north of the [[celestial equator]] are circumpolar constellations. In the northern latitudes, the informal term ''equatorial constellation'' has sometimes been used for constellations that lie to the south of the circumpolar constellations.&lt;ref name=steele1884/&gt; Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations can include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south,&lt;ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/&gt; or those that pass overhead between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They generally include all constellations that intersect the celestial equator.

==History==
{{further|Former constellations|History of the constellations}}
The current list of 88 constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] since 1922 is based on the 48 listed by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' in the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/constellations/| title = The Constellations| author = International Astronomical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm| title = Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ptolemy's catalogue is informed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century BC who introduced earlier [[Babylonian astronomy]] to the Hellenistic culture. Of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy, thirty can be shown to have a much longer history, reaching back into at least the [[Late Bronze Age]]{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}. This concerns the [[zodiacal constellations]] in particular.

===Ancient Near East===
{{See also|Babylonian star catalogues|MUL.APIN}}
The oldest catalogues of stars and constellations are from [[Babylonian astronomy#Old Babylonian astronomy|Old Babylonian astronomy]], beginning in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. The numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] names in these catalogues suggest that they build on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].
The classical [[Zodiac]] is a product of a revision of the Old Babylonian system in later [[Neo-Babylonian]] astronomy 6th century BC.
Knowledge of the Neo-Babylonian zodiac is also reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[E. W. Bullinger]] interpreted the creatures appearing in the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] (and thence in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,&lt;ref&gt;E.W. Bullinger, ''The Witness of the Stars''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. James Kennedy, ''The Real Meaning of the Zodiac''.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Lion as [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], the Bull is [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], the Man representing Aquarius and the Eagle standing in for Scorpio.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', Vol. 1 (New York: Dover Publications, 1899, p. 213-215.) argued for ''Scorpio'' having previously been called ''Eagle''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The biblical [[Book of Job]] also makes reference to a number of constellations, including  {{lang|he|עיש ''`Ayish''}} &quot;bier&quot;,  {{lang|he| כסיל ''Kĕciyl''}} &quot;fool&quot;  and {{lang|he| כימה ''Kiymah''}} &quot;heap&quot; (Job 9:9, 38:31-32), rendered as &quot;Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades&quot; by the [[KJV]], but ''`Ayish'' &quot;the bier&quot; actually corresponding to [[Ursa Major]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5906&amp;t=KJV Gesenius, ''Hebrew Lexicon'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Mazzaroth]]'' {{lang|he|מַזָּרוֹת}}, a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'' in Job 38:32, may be the Hebrew word for the zodiacal constellations.

The Greeks adopted the Babylonian system in the 4th century BC. A total of twenty Ptolemaic constellations are directly continued from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of the Greek Constellations'', by [[Bradley E. Schaefer]]. [[Scientific American]], November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Egypt, the observation of stars such as Sirius in the day and night sky were used from a very ancient period, in order to predict the Nile Flood.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn A. Krebs.  ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World '' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; This practical observation of the stars was also associated with a very complex cosmology that involved various gods and sprits, some of whom were associated with stars and heavenly bodies, such as Sothis/[[Sopdet]], who was likely associated with Sirius and [[Sah]] who was associated with Orion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilkinson, Richard H. |title=The complete gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |year=2003 |pages=167–168, 211|isbn=0-500-05120-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Murdock.  ''Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection'' (Stellar House Publishing, 2008, p. 201.)&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmology and practice of astronomy eventually led to the Egyptians producing [[decans|decanal clocks]] on coffin lids&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Clagett 1995, p. 111&quot;&gt;Marshall Clagett ''Ancient Egyptian Science: Calendars, clocks and astronomy'' (American Philosophical Society, 1995, p. 111.)&lt;/ref&gt; and star charts featuring their gods and star observations on the ceilings of tombs and temples.  Over time these became more complex, featuring various human and anthropomorphic figures representing the planets, stars and various constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Clagett 1995, p. 111&quot;/&gt;    This tradition was later combined with Greek and Babylonian astronomical systems under the Ptolemies culminating in the [[Dendera zodiac|Zodiac of Dendera]].  The first circular zodiac showing all the constellations we are familiar with, along with Egyptian Constellations, [[Decans]] and [[Planets]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rogers, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions]&quot;, ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' '''108''' (1998) 9–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0wPPdxNrZi0_mMbp&amp;id=xznqw5EkOCMC Zodiac of Dendera], epitome. (Exhibition, Leic. square). J. Haddon, 1825.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu or Indian Constellation===
{{Main|Nakshatra}}
'''Nakshatra''' ([[Devanagari]]:   ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'') is the term for [[lunar mansion]] in [[Hindu astrology]]. A nakshatra is one of 27 (sometimes also 28) sectors along the ecliptic. Their names are related to the most prominent  [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the respective sectors.

The starting point for the nakshatras is the point on the ecliptic directly opposite to the star [[Spica]] called ''Chitrā'' in [[Sanskrit]] (other slightly different definitions exist). It is called ''Meshādi'' or the &quot;[[first point of Aries|start of Aries]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
The ecliptic is divided into each of the ''nakshatra''s eastwards starting from this point.
The number of nakshatras reflects the number of days in a [[sidereal month]] (modern value: 27.32 days), the width of a nakshatra traversed by the moon in about one day. Each nakshatra is further subdivided into four quarters (or ''pada''s). These play a role in popular Hindu astrology, where each ''pada'' is associated with a syllable, conventionally chosen as the first syllable of the [[Hindu given names|given name]] of a child born when the moon was in the corresponding ''pada''.

The nakshatras of traditional bhartiya astronomy are based on a list of 28 asterisms found in the [[Atharvaveda]]  (AVŚ 19.7) and also in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The first [[Indian astronomy|astronomical]] text that lists them is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]''.

In classical Hindu mythology ([[Mahabharata]], [[Harivamsa]]), the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to [[Daksha]]. They are personified as daughters of the deity and as mythological wives of [[Chandra]], the moon god, or alternatively the daughters of [[Kashyapa]], the brother of Daksha.&lt;ref&gt;Mythology of the Hindus, by Charles Coleman p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the nakshatras is governed as 'lord' by one of the  [[navagraha|nine graha]] in the following sequence: [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]] (South Lunar Node), [[Shukra]] (Venus),  Ravi or [[Surya]] (Sun), [[Chandra]] (Moon), [[Mangala]] (Mars), [[Rahu]] (North Lunar Node), Guru or [[Brihaspati]] (Jupiter), [[Shani]] (Saturn) and [[Budha]] (Mercury). This cycle repeats itself three times to cover all 27 nakshatras. The lord of each nakshatra determines the planetary period known as the [[Dasha (astrology)|dasha]], which is considered of major importance in forecasting the life path of the individual in Hindu astrology.

In [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the term  ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'' may refer to any heavenly body, or to &quot;the stars&quot; collectively. The classical sense of &quot;lunar mansion&quot; is first found in the [[Atharvaveda]], and becomes the primary meaning of the term in [[Classical Sanskrit]].
&lt;!--The [[Sanskrit verb|verbal root]]  ''{{IAST|nákṣ}}'' means &quot;to approach, come near&quot;.--&gt;

===Greece-Roman===
There is only limited information on indigenous Greek constellations. Some evidence is found in [[Hesiod]].{{clarify|date=September 2011}}
Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [[Hellenistic era]], first introduced to Greece by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century BC.
The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [[Aratus]], dating to the 3rd century BC.
The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]].

The basis of western astronomy as taught during [[Late Antiquity]] and until the [[Early Modern period]] is the ''[[Almagest]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], written in the 2nd century.

===Classical Chinese constellations===
{{Main|Chinese constellation}}
{{further|Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era}}
In classical [[Chinese astronomy]], the northern sky is divided geometrically, into five &quot;enclosures&quot; and [[twenty-eight mansions]] along the ecliptic, grouped into [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of seven asterisms each.
The 28 lunar mansions are one of the most important and also the most ancient structures in the Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC.
Parallels to the earliest Babylonian (Sumerian) star catalogues suggest that the ancient Chinese system did not arise independently from that of the [[Ancient Near west and East]].&lt;ref&gt;Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, p. 18, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Classical Chinese astronomy is recorded in the [[Han period]] and appears in the form of three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the [[Zhanguo period]]. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [[Chen Zhuo]], an astronomer of the 3rd century ([[Three Kingdoms period]]).
Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [[Tang period]] records, notably by [[Qutan Xida]].
The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to the Tang period and was preserved as part of the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]]. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [[Song Dynasty]], and during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] became increasingly influenced by [[medieval Islamic astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, chapter 2, 15-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern era===
The constellations around the South Pole were not observable from north of the equator, by Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese or Arabs.

The modern constellations in this region were defined during the [[age of exploration]], notably by  Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] at the end of sixteenth century.
They were  depicted by Johann Bayer in his [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title = Bayer's southern star chart| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several more were created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in his star catalogue, published in 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title = Lacaille's southern planisphere| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern proposals for new constellations were not successful; an example is  [[Quadrans Muralis|Quadrans]], eponymous of the [[Quadrantid]] meteors, now divided between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].
The classical constellation of [[Argo Navis]]  was broken up into several different constellations, for the convenience of stellar cartographers.

By the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Xu Guangqi]] introduced  23 asterisms of the southern sky based on the knowledge of western star charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sun | first=Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin | editor-link=Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | year=1997 | pages=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=0-7923-4066-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These asterisms have since been incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps.

==IAU constellations==
{{constellations_ecliptic_equirectangular_plot.svg}}
{{Main|88 modern constellations}}

In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] aided the IAU (International Astronomical Union) in dividing the celestial sphere into 88 official constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922. | accessdate = 2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] or [[Scorpius]].
The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public/constellations//| title = The IAU on constellations| accessdate = 2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

In 1930, the boundaries between the 88 constellations were devised by [[Eugène Delporte]] along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data he used originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made the proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that due to the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Davenhall &amp; S.K. Leggett, [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/VI/49/constell.pdf &quot;A Catalogue of Constellation Boundary Data&quot;], (Centre de Donneés astronomiques de Strasbourg, February 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

==Asterisms==
[[File:Starry night at Mount Everest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Much of the dark space between stars, as seen in the sky of the image above, is due to the human eye's low light sensitivity. Other images (like the [[Hubble Deep Field]] – not pictured) detect far more stars.]]
{{main|Asterism (astronomy)}}
The stars of the main asterism within a constellation are usually given Greek letters in their order of brightness, the so-called [[Bayer designation]] introduced by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603.
A total of 1,564 stars are so identified, out of approximately 10,000 stars visible to the [[naked eye]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bright Star Catalogue]] lists 9,110 objects of the night sky which are visible to the naked eye ([[apparent magnitude]] of 6.5 or brighter). 9,096 of these are stars, all of them well within [[Milky Way|our galaxy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The brightest stars, usually the stars that make up the constellation's eponymous asterism,  also retain proper names, often from Arabic.
For example, the &quot;Little Dipper&quot; asterism of the constellation [[Ursa Minor]] has ten stars with Bayer designation, [[α UMi]] to [[π UMi]]. Of these ten stars, seven have a proper name, viz.
[[Polaris]] (α UMi), [[Kochab]] (β UMi), [[Pherkad]] (γ UMi), [[Yildun]] (δ UMi), [[Urodelus]] (ε UMi), [[Ahfa al Farkadain]]     (ζ UMi) and [[Anwar al Farkadain]]  (η UMi).

The stars within an asterism rarely have any substantial astrophysical relationship to each other, and their apparent proximity when viewed from Earth disguises the fact that they are far apart, some being much farther from Earth than others. However, there are some exceptions: many of the stars in the constellation of [[Ursa Major]] (including most of the [[Big Dipper]]) are genuinely close to one another, travel through the [[galaxy]] with similar [[proper motion|velocities]], and are likely to have formed together as part of a [[star cluster|cluster]] that is slowly dispersing. These stars form the [[Ursa Major moving group]].

==Dark cloud constellations==
[[File:Emu public.jpg|frame|The &quot;[[Emu]] in the sky,&quot; a constellation defined by dark clouds rather than the stars. An IAU interpretation would recognise [[Crux]] (the Southern Cross) above the emu's head and [[Scorpius]] on the left. The head of the emu is the [[Coalsack]].]]
{{further|Great Rift (astronomy)}}

The Great Rift, a series of dark patches in the [[Milky Way]], is more visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern. It vividly stands out when conditions are otherwise so dark that the Milky Way's central region casts shadows on the ground. Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these &quot;dark cloud constellations.&quot; Members of the [[Inca]] civilization identified various dark areas or [[dark nebula]]e in the [[Milky Way]] as animals, and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html The Incan View of the Night Sky]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]] also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the &quot;emu in the sky&quot; whose head is formed by the [[Coalsack]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">The modern constellation '''[[Tucana]]''' is not included in the [[Three Enclosures]] and [[Twenty-Eight Mansions]] system of traditional [[Traditional Chinese star names#Categories of Chinese traditional uranography|Chinese uranography]] because its stars are too far south for observers in China to know about them prior to the introduction of Western star charts. Based on the work of [[Xu Guangqi]] and the German Jesuit missionary [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] in the late [[Ming Dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sun | first=Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin |editor-link = Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | year=1997 | pages=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=0-7923-4066-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this constellation has been classified as one of the 23 '''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]]''' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') under the name '''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Crane]]''' (鶴, ''Hè'') and '''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Bird's Beak]]''' (鳥喙, ''Niǎohuì'').

The name of the western constellation in modern Chinese is 杜鵑座 (''dù juān zuò''), meaning &quot;the cuckoo constellation&quot;.

First attested in English in 1785, the word ''camelopardalis'' comes from [[Latin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcamelopardalis |title = camelopardalis |last1 = Lewis |first1 = Charlton T. |last2 = Short |first2 = Charles |work = A Latin Dictionary |publisher = Perseus Digital Library|accessdate =8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the [[romanisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;καμηλοπάρδαλις&quot; meaning &quot;[[giraffe]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkamhlopa%2Frdalis |title = καμηλοπάρδαλις

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Camelopardalis}}

Although Camelopardalis is the 18th largest constellation, it is not a particularly bright constellation, as the brightest stars are only of fourth magnitude. In fact, it only contains four stars above magnitude 5.0.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=241}}

*'''[[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]]''' is a blue-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3, 5000 light-years from Earth. Its distance is unusual for a naked-eye star.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[Beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]]''' is the brightest star in Camelopardalis with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.03. This star is a [[double star]], with components of magnitudes 4.0{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}} and 8.6. The primary is a yellow-hued supergiant 1000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[11 Camelopardalis|11 Cam]]''' is a star of magnitude 5.2, 650 light-years from Earth. It is very close to magnitude 6.1 [[12 Camelopardalis|12 Cam]], also 650 light-years from Earth, but the two stars are not a true double star because of their separation.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[Struve 1694|Σ 1694]] (Struve 1694, 32 Cam)''' is a [[binary star]] 300 light-years from Earth. Both components have a blue-white hue; the primary is of magnitude 5.4 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.9.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]]''' is the second brightest star, though it has neither a [[Bayer designation|Bayer]] nor a [[Flamsteed designation]]. It is of magnitude 4.21 and is slightly [[variable star|variable]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}}

Other variable stars are [[U Camelopardalis]], [[VZ Camelopardalis]], and [[Mira variable]]s [[T Camelopardalis]], [[X Camelopardalis]], and [[R Camelopardalis]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}}

In 2011 a supernova was discovered in the constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/10-year-old-canadian-girl-youngest-discover-supernova |title = 10-Year-Old Canadian Girl Is The Youngest Person Ever to Discover a Supernova |last = Boyle |first = Rebecca |accessdate =8 June 2012 |journal = Popular Science |date = 3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
Camelopardalis is in the part of the [[celestial sphere]] facing away from the [[galactic plane]]. Accordingly, many distant galaxies are visible within its borders. [[NGC 2403]] is a galaxy in the [[M81 group]] of galaxies, located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} with a redshift of 0.00043. It is classified as being between an [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and a [[spiral galaxy]] because it has faint arms and a large central bulge. NGC 2403 was first discovered by the 18th century astronomer [[William Herschel]], who was working in England at the time.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} It has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 8.0 and is approximately 0.25° long.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

[[NGC 1502]] is a magnitude 6.9 [[open cluster]] about 3,000 [[light year]]s from Earth. It has about 45 bright members, and features a double star of magnitude 7.0 at its center.&lt;ref&gt;Revised NGC/IC Data 2013. Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke.&lt;/ref&gt; NGC 1502 is also associated with [[Kemble's Cascade]], a simple but beautiful asterism appearing in the sky as a chain of stars 2.5° long that is parallel to the Milky Way and is pointed towards [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} [[NGC 1501]] is a planetary nebula located roughly 1.4° south of NGC 1502.

NGC 2655 is a small galaxy. [[IC 342]] is one of the brightest two galaxies in the [[IC 342/Maffei Group]] of galaxies. The dwarf irregular galaxy [[NGC 1569]] is a magnitude 11.9 [[starburst galaxy]], about 11 million light years away.

[[MS0735.6+7421]] is a galaxy cluster with a [[redshift]] of 0.216, located 2.6 billion light-years from Earth. It is unique for its [[intracluster medium]], which emits [[x-rays]] at a very high rate. This galaxy cluster features two cavities 600,000 light-years in diameter, caused by its central [[supermassive black hole]], which emits jets of matter. MS0735.6+7421 is one of the largest and most distant examples of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

Tombaugh 5 is a fairly dim open cluster in Camelopardalis. It has an overall magnitude of 8.4 and is located 5,800 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class c and Trumpler class III 1 r cluster, meaning that it is irregularly shaped and appears loose. Though it is detached from the star field, it is not concentrated at its center at all. It has more than 100 stars which do not vary widely in brightness,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=89}} mostly being of the 15th and 16th magnitude.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=91}}

[[NGC 2146]] is an 11th magnitude barred spiral [[starburst galaxy|starburst]] galaxy conspicuously warped by interaction with a neighbour.

[[MACS0647-JD]], one of the possible candidates for the farthest known galaxies in the universe ([[Redshift|z]]= 10.7), is also in Camelopardalis.

=== Space exploration ===
The [[space probe]] ''[[Voyager 1]]'' is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its power source will be long dead.

==History==
[[Image:Camelopardalisurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Camelopardalis as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Above it are shown the now-abandoned constellations of [[Tarandus (constellation)|Tarandus]] and [[Custos Messium]].]]

Camelopardalis was created by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1613 to represent the animal [[Rebecca]] rode to marry [[Isaac]] in [[the Bible]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] gave it the official name of &quot;Camelopardus&quot; or &quot;Camelopardalis&quot; because he saw the constellation's many faint stars as the spots of a giraffe.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=241}}

[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars of Camelopardalis into a [[giraffe]] figure.
[[Image:Camelopardalis constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of [[H. A. Rey]]'s method of connecting the stars of the constellation Camelopardalis, in order to show a giraffe.]] &lt;br clear=left&gt;The giraffe's body consists of the quadrangle of stars [[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]], [[beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]], [[BE Camelopardalis|BE Cam]], and [[Gamma Camelopardalis|γ Cam]]: α Cam and β Cam being of the fourth magnitude. The stars [[HD 42818]] (HR 2209) and [[M Camelopardalis|M Cam]] form the [[head]] of the giraffe, and the stars M Cam and α Cam form the giraffe's long [[neck]]. Stars β Cam and [[7 Camelopardalis|7 Cam]] form the giraffe's front leg, and [[variable star]]s BE Cam and [[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]] form the giraffe's hind leg.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Camelopardalis are located within a group of circumpolar stars called the [[Purple Forbidden Enclosure]] (紫微垣 ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'').

'''Puppis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|p|ɨ|s}} is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky.  Puppis, the [[Poop deck|Poop Deck]], was originally part of an over-large constellation, the ship of &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, [[Argo Navis]], which centuries after its initial description, was divided into three parts, the other two being [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the keel and hull), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the sails of the ship). Puppis is the largest of the three constellations in square degrees. It is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:PuppisCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Puppis as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
Argo Navis was sub-divided in 1752 by the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], forming Puppis. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo's [[Bayer designation]]s. Therefore Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

[[File:A cosmic concoction in NGC 2467.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A cosmic concoction in [[NGC 2467]]]]

===Planetary systems===
Several [[extrasolar planet]] systems have been found around stars in the constellation Puppis, including:
* On July 1, 2003, a [[extrasolar planet|planet]] was found orbiting the star [[HD 70642]]. This [[planetary system]] is much like [[Jupiter]] with a wide, circular orbit and a long-period.
* On May 17, 2006, [[HD 69830]] (the nearest star of this constellation) was discovered to have three Neptune-mass planets, the first multi-planetary system without any Jupiter-like or [[Saturn]]-like planets. The star also hosts an [[asteroid belt]] at the region between middle planet to outer planet.
* On June 21, 2007, the first extrasolar planet found in the [[open cluster]] [[NGC 2423]], was discovered around the [[red giant]] star [[NGC 2423-3]]. The planet is at least 10.6 times the mass of Jupiter and orbits at 2.1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] distance.
* On September 22, 2008, two Jupiter-like planets were discovered around [[HD 60532]]. [[HD 60532 b]] has a [[minimum mass]] of 1.03&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and orbits at 0.759 AU and takes 201.3 days to complete the orbit. [[HD 60532 c]] has a minimum mass of 2.46&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and orbits at 1.58 AU and takes 604 days to complete the orbit.

===Deep-sky objects===
As the [[Milky Way]] runs through Puppis, there are a large number of [[open cluster]]s in the constellation. [[Messier 46|M46]] and [[Messier 47|M47]] are two open clusters in the same binocular field. M47 can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies, and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude. [[Open Cluster M93|Messier 93]] (M93) is another open cluster somewhat to the south. [[NGC 2451]] is a very bright open cluster containing the star [[c Puppis]] and the near [[NGC 2477]] is a good target for small telescopes. The star [[Pi Puppis]] is the main component of a bright group of stars known as [[Collinder 135]].

M46 is a circular open cluster with an overall magnitude of 6.1 at a distance of approximately 5400 light-years from Earth. The [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 2438]] is superimposed; it is approximately 2900 light-years from Earth. M46 is classified as a Shapley class f and a Trumpler class III 2 m cluster. This means that it is a rich cluster that appears distinct from the star field; however, it is not  at its center. The cluster's stars, numbering between 50 and 100, have a moderate range in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=85-86}}

'''Perseus''', named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] hero [[Perseus]], is a [[constellation]] in the [[northern sky]].  It was one of 48 listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and among the [[88 modern constellations]] defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). It is located in the [[Celestial sphere|northern celestial hemisphere]] near several other constellations named after legends surrounding Perseus, including [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] to the west and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] to the north. Perseus is also bordered by [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the south, [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] to the east, [[Camelopardalis]] to the north, and [[Triangulum]] to the west.

The [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] passes through Perseus but is mostly obscured by [[molecular cloud]]s. The constellation's brightest star is the yellow-white [[supergiant]] [[Alpha Persei]] (also called Mirfak), which shines at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 1.79. It and many of the surrounding stars  are members of an [[open cluster]] known as the [[Alpha Persei Cluster]]. The best-known star, however, is [[Algol]] (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its [[variable star|variability]], which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an [[eclipsing binary]]. Other notable star systems in Perseus include [[X Persei]], a binary system containing a [[neutron star]], and [[GK Persei]], a [[nova]] that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The [[Double Cluster]], comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the [[Perseus Cluster]] (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million [[light-year]]s from Earth. It hosts the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of the annual [[Perseids]] [[meteor shower]]—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.

===In non-Western astronomy===
{{See also|Chinese astronomy}}
Four [[Chinese constellations]] are&lt;!--were?--&gt; contained in the area of the sky identified with Perseus in the West. ''Tiānchuán'' (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third [[paranatellon]] (small [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of stars) of the third house of the [[White Tiger of the West]], representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a catastrophic flood season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jīshuǐ'' (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it.&lt;ref name=schl349&gt;Schlegel, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dàlíng'' (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon of that house, representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their internment was represented by ''Jīshī'' (積屍, Algol), the sixth paranatellon of the house.&lt;ref name=schl349/&gt; The [[Double Cluster]], h and Chi Persei, had special significance in [[Chinese astronomy]]. Known as Hsi and Ho, the two clusters represented two astronomers who failed to predict a [[total solar eclipse]] and were subsequently beheaded.&lt;ref name=Stall&gt;Staal, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Polynesia, Perseus was not commonly recognized as a separate constellation; the only people that named it were those of the [[Society Islands]], who called it ''Faa-iti'', meaning &quot;Little Valley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Makemson, 1941, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Algol may have been named ''Matohi'' by the [[Māori people]], but the evidence for this identification is disputed. ''Matohi'' (&quot;Split&quot;) occasionally came into conflict with ''Tangaroa-whakapau'' over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near [[Aldebaran]] but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Makemson, 1941, pp. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Perseus is bordered by [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the south, [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] to the east, [[Camelopardalis]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopea]] to the north, and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] and [[Triangulum]] to the west. Covering 615 [[square degree]]s, it ranks twenty-fourth of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the northern sky during the Northern Hemisphere's spring. Its main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consists of 19 stars. The constellation's boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a 26-sided polygon. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|01|29.1}} and {{RA|04|51.2}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between {{dec|30.92}} and {{dec|59.11}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Perseus, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#per | accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation &quot;Per&quot; for the constellation in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=H.

[[Algol]] (from the Arabic '''رأس الغول''' ''Ra's al-Ghul'', which means ''The Demon's Head''), also known by its [[Bayer designation]] Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing the eye of the Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called ''Rosh ha Satan'' (&quot;[[Satan]]'s Head&quot;) in Hebrew. Located 92.8 [[light-year]]s from Earth, it varies in [[apparent magnitude]] from a minimum of 3.5 to a maximum of 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Deep Sky Objects |last = Levy |first = D.

Named Atik, [[Zeta Persei]] is the third-brightest star in the constellation at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a [[moving group]] of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, that may or may not be gravitationally bound to the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/zetaper.html |title=Zeta Persei|last=Kaler|first=J.

Its brightest stars are [[Rigel]] (Beta Orionis) and [[Betelgeuse]] (Alpha Orionis), a blue-white and a red [[supergiant]] respectively. Many of the other brighter stars in the constellation are hot, blue supergiant stars. The three stars in the middle of the constellation form an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as [[Orion's belt]]. The [[Orion Nebula]] is located south of Orion's belt.

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sig07-006.jpg|thumb|250px|Star formation in the constellation Orion as photographed in [[infrared]] by [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].]]

The earliest depiction that has been linked to the constellation of Orion is a prehistoric ([[Aurignacian]]) mammoth ivory carving found in a cave in the Ach valley in Germany in 1979. Archaeologists have estimated it to have been fashioned approximately 32,000 to 38,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Anthropoid in the Sky:  Does a 32,000 Years Old Ivory Plate Show the Constellation Orion Combined with a Pregnancy Calendar |last1=Rappenglück|first1=Michael |year= 2001 |publisher=Uppsala Astronomical Observatory |booktitle=Symbols, Calendars and Orientations: Legacies of Astronomy in Culture|conference=IXth Annual meeting of the European Society for Astronomy in Culture (SEAC)|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=3&amp;idsubentity=1 |title=The Decorated Plate of the Geißenklösterle, Germany  |website=UNESCO: Portal to the Heritage of Astronomy |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Mesopotamian traditions]&quot;, ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' '''108''' (1998) 9–28&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian constellation was sacred to [[Papsukkal|Papshukal]] and [[Ninshubur]], both minor gods fulfilling the role of 'messenger to the gods'. Papshukal was closely associated with the figure of a walking [[bird]] on Babylonian boundary stones, and on the star map the figure of the [[Rooster]] was located below and behind the figure of the True Shepherd—both constellations represent the herald of the gods, in his bird and human forms respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 218ff &amp; 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The stars of Orion were associated with [[Osiris]], the sun-god of rebirth and the afterlife, by the [[ancient Egyptian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Oxford Guide p302-307&quot;&gt;The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology, Edited by Donald B.

Orion has also been identified with the  [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] called [[Unas]] who, according to the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'', became great by eating the flesh of his mortal enemies and then slaying and devouring the gods themselves. This was based on a belief in [[contagious magic]] whereby consuming the flesh of great people would bring inheritance of their power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie 1907 167–168&quot;/&gt; After devouring the gods and absorbing their spirits and powers, Unas journeys through the day and night sky to become the star Sahu, or Orion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Oxford Guide p302-307&quot;/&gt;  The ''Pyramid Texts'' also show that the dead Pharaoh was identified with the god Osiris, whose form in the stars was often said to be the constellation Orion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Oxford Guide p302-307&quot;/&gt;

The [[Armenians]] identified their legendary patriarch and founder [[Hayk]] with Orion. ''Hayk'' is also the name of the Orion constellation in the Armenian translation of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/8*.html Vahan Kurkjian, &quot;History of Armenia,&quot; Michigan, 1968]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible]] mentions Orion three times, naming it &quot;Kesil&quot; (כסיל, literally - fool). Though, this name perhaps is etymologically connected with &quot;Kislev&quot;, the name for the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar (i.e. November–December), which, in turn, may derive from the Hebrew root K-S-L as in the words &quot;kesel, kisla&quot; (כֵּסֶל, כִּסְלָה, hope, positiveness), i.e. hope for winter rains.): [[Book of Job|Job]] 9:9 (&quot;He is the maker of the Bear and Orion&quot;), [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:31 (&quot;Can you loosen Orion`s belt?&quot;), and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:8 (&quot;He who made the [[Pleiades]] and Orion&quot;).
In ancient [[Aram (Biblical region)|Aram]], the constellation was known as ''N&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;phîlā′'', the ''[[Nephilim]]'' may have been Orion's descendants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]'', 1962, page 260 section 221f.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greco-Roman antiquity====
{{Main|Orion (mythology)}}
[[File:Aratea 58v.jpg|thumb|Orion in the 9th century [[Leiden Aratea]].]]
Orion's current name derives from [[Greek mythology]], in which Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter of ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/orion.htm Star Tales – Orion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; born to [[Euryale]], a [[Gorgon]], and [[Poseidon]] ([[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]), god of the sea in the Graeco-Roman tradition. One myth recounts [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]'s rage at Orion, who dared to say that he would kill every animal on the planet. The angry goddess tried to dispatch Orion with a [[scorpion]]. This is given as the reason that the constellations of [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, [[Ophiuchus]], the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an [[antidote]]. This is said to be the reason that the constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=61-62}}

The constellation is mentioned in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode]]s'' (Ode 3.27.18), [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (Book 5, line 283) and ''[[Iliad]]'', and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (Book 1, line 535)

In [[ancient Egypt]], the constellation of Orion represented [[Osiris]], who, after being killed by his evil brother [[Set (Egyptian religion)|Set]], was revived by his wife [[Isis]] to live immortal among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Mystery of the Sphinx.

===Middle East===

In medieval [[Muslim astronomy]], Orion was known as ''al-jabbar'', &quot;the giant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metlitzki|first=Dorothee|authorlink=Dorothee Metlitzki|title=The Matter of Araby in Medieval England|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=United States|isbn=0-300-11410-9|page=79|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=61OjyWngtdsC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion's sixth brightest star, [[Saiph]], is named from the Arabic, ''saif al-jabbar'', meaning &quot;sword of the giant&quot;.&lt;ref name=kaler&gt;{{citation | first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | work=Stars | title=SAIPH (Kappa Orionis) | publisher=University of Illinois | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/saiph.html | accessdate=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian antiquity===
In [[China]], Orion was one of the [[Twenty-eight mansions|28 lunar mansions]] ''Sieu (Xiu)'' （宿）. It is known as [[Three Stars (Chinese constellation)|''Shen'' （參）]], literally meaning &quot;three&quot;, for the stars of Orion's Belt. (See [[Chinese constellations]])

The [[Chinese character]] 參 ([[pinyin]] shēn) originally meant the constellation Orion ({{zh|c=參宿|p=shēnxiù}}); its [[Shang dynasty]] version, over three millennia old, contains at the top a representation of the three stars of Orion's belt atop a man's head (the bottom portion representing the sound of the word was added later).&lt;ref&gt;漢語大字典 Hànyǔ Dàzìdiǎn (in Chinese), 1992 (p.163). 湖北辭書出版社和四川辭書出版社 Húbĕi Cishu Chūbǎnshè and Sìchuān Cishu Chūbǎnshè, re-published in traditional character form by 建宏出版社 Jiànhóng Publ. in Taipei, Taiwan; ISBN 957-813-478-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rig Veda]] refers to the Orion Constellation as '''Mriga''' (The [[Deer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holay, P. V.|title=Vedic astronomers|journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India|volume=26|pages=91–106|bibcode=1998BASI...26...91H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said that two bright stars in the front and two bright stars in the rear are ''The hunting dogs'', the one comparatively less bright star in the middle and ahead of two front dogs is ''The hunter'' and three aligned bright stars are in the middle of all four hunting dogs is ''The Deer'' (The Mriga)  and three little aligned but less brighter stars is ''The Baby Deer''. The Mriga means Deer, locally known as ''Harnu'' in folk parlance. There are many folk songs narrating the ''Harnu''.   
The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] called Orion' Belt ''Bintang Tiga Beradik'' (the &quot;Three Brother Star&quot;).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===European folklore===
[[Image:OrionCC.jpg|thumb|220px|The constellation Orion as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
[[Image:Orion constellation with star labels.jpg|thumb|The constellation Orion with the major stars labelled.]]
In old [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] tradition, &quot;Orion&quot; is known as (magic) Archer (''Íjász''), or Reaper (''Kaszás''). In recently rediscovered myths he is called [[Nimrod]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] &quot;Nimród&quot;), the greatest hunter, father of the twins [[Hunor and Magor|&quot;Hunor&quot; and &quot;Magor&quot;]]). The &quot;π&quot; and &quot;o&quot; stars (on upper right) form together the [[reflex bow]] or the lifted scythe. In other Hungarian traditions, &quot;Orion's belt&quot; is known as &quot;Judge's stick&quot; (''Bírópálca'').&lt;ref&gt;Toroczkai-Wigand Ede : Öreg csillagok (&quot;Old stars&quot;), Hungary (1915) reedited with Műszaki Könyvkiadó METRUM (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In  [[Scandinavia]]n tradition, &quot;Orion's belt&quot; was known as [[Frigg]]'s [[Distaff]] (''Friggerock'') or [[Freyja]]'s distaff.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, Ebbe. (2004). ''Asa-Tors hammare, Gudar och jättar i tro och tradition''. Fält &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finns]] call the Orion's belt and the stars below it as ''Väinämöisen viikate'' ([[Väinämöinen]]'s [[scythe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ismo Elo |url=http://www.ursa.fi/yhd/uranus/luennot%202004/perusteet/tahdet.htm |title=T&amp;auml;hdet ja t&amp;auml;hdist&amp;ouml;t |publisher=Ursa.fi |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name for the asterism of Alnilam, Alnitak and Minkata is ''Väinämöisen vyö''' (Väinämöinen's Belt) and the stars &quot;hanging&quot; from the belt as ''Kalevanmiekka'' ([[Kalevi (mythology)|Kaleva]]'s [[sword]]).

In [[Siberia]], the [[Chukchi people]] see Orion as a hunter; an arrow he has shot is represented by Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), with the same figure as other Western depictions.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=63}}

===Americas===
The [[Seri people]] of northwestern Mexico call the three stars in the belt of Orion ''Hapj'' (a name denoting a hunter) which consists of three stars:  ''Hap'' (mule deer), ''Haamoja'' (pronghorn), and ''Mojet'' (bighorn sheep). ''Hap'' is in the middle and has been shot by the hunter; its blood has dripped onto [[Tiburón Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Mary B. |coauthors=Stephen A.

The same three stars are known in Spain and most of Latin America as &quot;Las tres Marías&quot; (Spanish for &quot;[[The Three Marys]]&quot;).
In Puerto Rico, the three stars are known as the &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (Spanish for [[Biblical Magi|The three Wise Men]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;elnuevodia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/tresreyesmagosenelcieloestanoche-1421862.html |title=Home - El Nuevo Día |publisher=Elnuevodia.com |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ojibwa]] (Chippewa) Native Americans call this constellation Kabibona'kan, the Winter Maker, as its presence in the night sky heralds winter.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

To the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is the spine of a bison. The great rectangle of Orion are the bison's ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus is the bison’s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as Tayamnisinte, is its tail.

===Contemporary symbolism===
The imagery of the belt and sword has found its way into popular western culture, for example in the form of the shoulder [[insignia]] of the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during both World Wars, probably owing to a pun on the name of the division's first commander, Major General [[John F. O'Ryan|John F. ''O'Ryan'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The defunct film distribution company [[Orion Pictures]] used the constellation as its logo.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====In fiction====

In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s mythology surrounding [[Middle-earth]], Orion is known as ''Menelvagor'', which is [[Sindarin]] for &quot;The Swordsman in the Sky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/swordsmanofthesky.html |title=Encyclopedia of Arda: Swordsman of the Sky |publisher=Glyphweb.com |date=1999-11-27 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the dying replicant [[Roy Batty]] introspectively delivers his [[tears in rain soliloquy|&quot;Tears in Rain&quot; soliloquy]]:
{{quote|I've... seen things you people wouldn't believe...  Attack ships on fire off the ''shoulder of Orion''. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those... moments... will be lost in time, like tears... in... rain. Time... to die...}}

In the sci-fi comedy ''[[Men In Black]]'', the last words of a dying alien disguised as a human were 'To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt'. It was later revealed that 'Orion's belt' referred to the collar of a cat named 'Orion'.

In the sci-fi television series ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'', the Orionid meteor shower is known as the ''Hunter Meteor Shower''. It comes to Haven once every twenty-seven years when the Barn, a space between two worlds, comes to take the mysterious woman away. When the Barn leaves, the Hunter passes safely overhead and [[The Troubles (Haven)|The Troubles]] end, making the town of Haven a haven for the Troubled again.

===Depictions===
In artistic renderings, the surrounding constellations are sometimes related to Orion: he is depicted standing next to the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] with his two hunting dogs [[Canis Major]] and [[Canis Minor]], fighting [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] He is sometimes depicted hunting [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[hare]]. He also sometimes is depicted to have a lion's hide in his hand.

There are alternative ways to visualise Orion. From the [[Southern Hemisphere]], Orion is oriented south-upward, and the belt and sword are sometimes called the saucepan or pot in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Orion's Belt is called ''Drie Konings'' (Three Kings) or the ''Drie Susters'' (Three Sisters) by [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] speakers in [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychohistorian.org/astronomy/ethnoastronomy/three_kings_cape_clouds.php Three Kings and the Cape Clouds at psychohistorian.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and are referred to as ''les Trois Rois&lt;!--or Troys Roys--&gt;'' (the Three Kings) in [[Alphonse Daudet|Daudet]]'s ''Lettres de Mon Moulin'' (1866). The appellation ''Driekoningen'' (the Three Kings) is also often found in 17th- and 18th-century Dutch star charts and seaman's guides. The same three stars are known in [[Spain]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Philippines]] as &quot;Las Tres Marías&quot; (The Three Marys), and as &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (The three Wise Men) in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;elnuevodia.com&quot;/&gt;

Even traditional depictions of Orion have varied greatly. [[Cicero]] drew Orion in a similar fashion to the modern depiction. The Hunter held an unidentified animal skin aloft in his right hand; his hand was represented by [[Omicron2 Orionis|Omicron&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Orionis]] and the skin was represented by the 5 stars designated [[Pi Orionis]]. Kappa and Beta Orionis represented his left and right knees, while Eta and Lambda Leporis were his left and right feet, respectively. As in the modern depiction, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta represented his belt. His left shoulder was represented by Alpha Orionis, and Mu Orionis made up his left arm. Lambda Orionis was his head and Gamma, his right shoulder. The depiction of [[Hyginus]] was similar to that of Cicero, though the two differed in a few important areas. Cicero's animal skin became Hyginus's shield (Omicron and Pi Orionis), and instead of an arm marked out by Mu Orionis, he holds a club (Chi Orionis). His right leg is represented by Theta Orionis and his left leg is represented by Lambda, Mu, and Epsilon Leporis. Further Western European and Arabic depictions have followed these two models.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=63}}

==Characteristics==
Orion is bordered by Taurus to the northwest, Eridanus to the southwest, Lepus to the south, [[Monoceros]] to the east, and Gemini to the northeast. Covering 594 square degrees, Orion ranks twenty-sixth of the 88 constellations in size. The constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|04|43.3}} and {{RA|06|25.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between {{dec|22.87}} and {{dec|−10.97}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Orion, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#ori | accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constellation's three-letter abbreviation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is &quot;Ori&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 |bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion is most visible in the evening sky from January to March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellyard, David; Tirion, Wil |year=2008 |title=The Southern Sky Guide|edition = 3rd|origyear=1993|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Gn0ivM4EK0C&amp;pg=PA4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Port Melbourne, Victoria |isbn= 978-0-521-71405-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.  In the tropics (less than about 8° from the equator), the constellation transits at the zenith.

In the period May–July (summer in the Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere), Orion is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes.  However, for much of [[Antarctica]] in the Southern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the [[horizon]] even at midday.  Stars (and thus Orion) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the North.  At the same time of day at the South Pole itself ([[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]), Rigel is only 8° above the horizon, and the Belt sweeps just along it.  In the Southern Hemisphere's summer months, when Orion is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible in Antarctica because the sun does not set at that time of year south of the Antarctic Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibonsmith.com/downunder.htm A Beginner's Guide to the Heavens in the Southern Hemisphere]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skymaps.com/downloads.html The Evening Sky Map Southern Hemisphere Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries close to the equator (e.g. Kenya, Indonesia, Colombia, Ecuador), Orion appears overhead in December around midnight and in the February evening sky.

==Navigational aid==
[[File:Orion-guide dark.svg|thumb|220px|left|Using Orion to find stars in neighbor constellations.]]
Orion is very useful as an aid to locating other stars. By extending the line of the Belt southeastward, [[Sirius]] (α [[Canis Major|CMa]]) can be found; northwestward, [[Aldebaran]] (α [[Taurus (constellation)|Tau]]). A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates the direction of [[Procyon]] (α [[Canis Minor|CMi]]). A line from [[Rigel]] through [[Betelgeuse]] points to [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (α [[Gemini (constellation)|Gem]] and β Gem).  Additionally, Rigel is part of the [[Winter Hexagon|Winter Circle]].  Sirius and [[Procyon]], which may be located from Orion by following imaginary lines (see map), also are points in both the [[Winter Triangle]] and the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donnayoung.org/science/stars/orion.htm Orion Constellation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=61}}

Orion's seven brightest stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], or pattern, in the night sky. Four stars—Rigel, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Saiph—form a large roughly rectangular shape, in the centre of which lie the  three stars of [[Orion's Belt]]—[[Alnitak]], [[Alnilam]] and [[Mintaka]]. Descending from the 'belt' is a smaller line of three stars (the middle of which is in fact not a star but the [[Orion Nebula]]), known as the hunter's 'sword'.

Many of the stars are luminous hot blue supergiants, with the stars of the belt and sword forming the [[Orion OB1 Association]]. Standing out by its red hue, Betelgeuse may nevertheless be a runaway member of the same group.

===Stars===
*'''[[Betelgeuse]]''',  alternatively by its [[Bayer designation]] Alpha Orionis, is a massive [[M-type star|M-type]] red [[supergiant]] star nearing the end of its life.

*'''[[Rigel]]''', which is also known as Beta Orionis, is a [[B-type star|B-type]] blue supergiant that is the sixth brightest star in the night sky. Similar to Betelgeuse, Rigel is [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] [[heavy element]]s in its core and will pass its [[supergiant]] stage soon (on an astronomical timescale), either collapsing in the case of a [[supernova]] or shedding its outer layers and turning into a [[white dwarf]].

*'''[[Epsilon Orionis|Alnilam]]''' is designated Epsilon Orionis, a consequence of Bayer's wish to name the three stars in Orion's Belt (from north to south) in alphabetical order.&lt;ref name=alnilam/&gt; Also called Al Nathin, Alnilam is named for the Arabic phrase meaning &quot;string of pearls&quot;.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=61}} Alnilam is a [[B-type star|B-type]] blue supergiant; despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun as [[Delta Orionis|Mintaka]] and [[Zeta Orionis|Alnitak]], the other two belt stars, its luminosity makes it nearly equal in magnitude. Alnilam is losing mass quickly, a consequence of its size; it is approximately four million years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;alnilam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/alnilam.html |title=Alnilam |accessdate=2011-11-28 |work=Jim Kaler's Stars |publisher=[[University of Illinois]], [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]-[[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Campus]] |year=2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63XBTECPT |archivedate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Alnitak]]''', meaning &quot;the girdle&quot;,{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=61}} was designated Zeta Orionis by Bayer, and is the easternmost star in Orion's Belt.  It is a [[Multiple star|triple star]] some 800 light years distant, with the primary star being a hot [[blue supergiant]] and the brightest [[O star|class O]] [[star]] in the night sky.

*'''[[Saiph]]''' was designated Kappa Orionis by Bayer, and serves as Orion's right foot.  It is of a similar distance and size to Rigel, but appears much fainter, as its hot surface temperature (46,000&amp;nbsp;°F or 26,000&amp;nbsp;°C) causes it to emit most of its light in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the spectrum.

Of the lesser stars, [[Hatsya]] (or Iota Orionis) forms the tip of Orion's sword, whilst [[Meissa]] (or Lambda Orionis) forms Orion's head. Iota Orionis is also called Nair al-Saif, Arabic for &quot;the brightest in the sword&quot;.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=61}}

===Belt===
{{main|Orion's Belt}}
{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=200 |image1=Cintura di Orione binocolo.png |caption1=Orion's Belt |image2=Orion Belt.jpg |caption2=Closeup Image of Orion's Belt}}
'''Orion's Belt''' or '''The Belt of Orion''' is an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within the constellation. It consists of the three bright stars [[Zeta Orionis|Zeta]] (Alnitak), [[Epsilon Orionis|Epsilon]] (Alnilam), and [[Delta Orionis|Delta]] (Mintaka). Alnitak is around 800 light years away from earth and is 100,000 times more luminous than the [[Sun]]; much of its radiation is in the  ultraviolet range, which the human eye cannot see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/alnitak.html |title=Alnitak |publisher=Stars.astro.illinois.edu |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alnilam is approximately 1340 light years away from Earth, shines with magnitude 1.70, and with ultraviolet light is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun.&lt;ref name=alnilam /&gt; Mintaka is 915 light years away and shines with magnitude 2.21. It is 90,000 times more luminous than the Sun and is a double star: the two orbit each other every 5.73 days.&lt;ref name=kalerMintaka/&gt;
Looking for Orion's Belt in the night sky is the easiest way to locate the constellation. In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion's Belt is best visible in the night sky during the month of January around 9:00 pm, when it is approximately around the local [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].&lt;ref name=dolanOrion /&gt;

Just southwest of Alnitak lies [[Sigma Orionis]], a multiple star system composed of five stars that have a combined apparent magnitude of 3.7 and lying 1150 light years distant. Southwest of Mintaka lies the quadruple star [[Eta Orionis]].

===Head===
Three stars compose a small triangle that marks the head. The apex is marked by [[Meissa]] (Lambda Orionis), a hot blue giant of spectral type O8 III and apparent magnitude 3.54, which lies some 1100 light years distant. Phi-1 and Phi-2 Orionis make up the base. Also nearby is the very young star [[FU Orionis]].

===North Arrow===
Together the 'Alnitak, Alnilam, &amp; Mintaka', the 'M42, M43' at the lower end form the tail of an arrow while 'Alnilam' form the head of the arrow. All together form an arrow that always points 'NORTH'. Therefore, it is used as navigational guide at night especially in the Sahara desert where there are not many natural signs.

===Club===
Stretching north from Betelgeuse are the stars that make up Orion's club. [[Mu Orionis]] marks the elbow, [[Nu Orionis|Nu]] and [[Xi Orionis|Xi]] mark the handle of the club, and [[Chi1 Orionis|Chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Chi2 Orionis|Chi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] mark the end of the club. Just east of Chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the Mira-type variable red giant [[U Orionis]].

===Shield===
West from Bellatrix lie six stars all designated [[Pi Orionis]] ([[Pi1 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]], [[Pi2 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]], [[Pi3 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]], [[Pi4 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]], [[Pi5 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]] and [[Pi6 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Ori]]) which make up Orion's shield.

===Meteor showers===
Around 20 October each year the [[Orionids|Orionid meteor shower]] (Orionids) reaches its peak. Coming from the border with the constellation Gemini as many as 20 meteors per hour can be seen.&lt;!-- not cited with an inline citation --&gt; The shower's parent body is [[Halley's Comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 22 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|This view brings out many fainter features, such as [[Barnard's Loop|Barnards loop]].]]
Hanging from Orion's belt is his sword, consisting of the multiple stars θ1 and θ2 Orionis, called the [[Trapezium (astronomy)|Trapezium]] and the [[Orion Nebula]] (M42). This is a spectacular object that can be clearly identified with the naked eye as something other than a star. Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed. The Trapezium cluster has many newborn stars, including several [[brown dwarfs]], all of which are at an approximate distance of 1,500 light-years. Named for the four bright stars that form a [[trapezoid]], it is largely illuminated by the brightest stars, which are only a few hundred thousand years old. Observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] show both the extreme temperatures of the main stars—up to 60,000 [[Kelvin]]—and the [[star formation|star forming regions]] still extant in the surrounding nebula.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messier 78|M78]] (NGC 2068) is a nebula in Orion. With an overall magnitude of 8.0, it is significantly dimmer than the Great Orion Nebula that lies to its south; however, it is at approximately the same distance, at 1600 light-years from Earth. It can easily be mistaken for a [[comet]] in the eyepiece of a telescope. M78 is associated with the [[variable star]] [[V351 Orionis]], whose magnitude changes are visible in very short periods of time.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=99–100}} Another fairly bright nebula in Orion is [[NGC 1999]], also close to the Great Orion Nebula. It has an integrated magnitude of 10.5 and is 1500 light-years from Earth. The variable star [[V380 Orionis]] is embedded in NGC 1999.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=107}}

Another famous [[nebula]] is [[Index Catalogue|IC]] 434, the [[Horsehead Nebula]], near ζ Orionis. It contains a dark dust cloud whose shape gives the nebula its name.

Besides these nebulae, surveying Orion with a small [[telescope]] will reveal a wealth of interesting deep-sky objects, including [[Messier 43|M43]], [[Messier 78|M78]], as well as multiple stars including [[Iota Orionis]] and [[Sigma Orionis]]. A larger telescope may reveal objects such as [[Barnard's Loop]] and the [[Flame Nebula]] (NGC 2024), as well as fainter and tighter multiple stars and nebulae.

All of these nebulae are part of the larger [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]], which is located approximately 1,500 light-years away and is hundreds of light-years across.  It is one of the most intense regions of stellar formation visible in our galaxy.

==Future==
Orion is located on the celestial equator, but it will not always be so located due to the effects of [[precession]] of the Earth's axis. Orion lies well south of the [[ecliptic]], and it only happens to lie on the celestial equator because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000 Orion will be far enough south that it will become invisible from the latitude of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/moonkmft/Articles/Precession.html |title=Precession |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further in the future, Orion's stars will gradually move away from the constellation due to [[proper motion]]. However, Orion's brightest stars all lie at a large distance from the Earth on an astronomical scale—much farther away than [[Sirius]], for example. Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, with the exception of a few of its stars eventually exploding as [[supernova]]e, for example [[Betelgeuse]], which is predicted to explode sometime in the next million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alasdair|title=Earth may soon have a second sun|url=http://io9.com/5738542/earth-may-soon-have-a-second-sun|work=io9|publisher=Space Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ursa Major''' ([[Latin]]: &quot;Larger Bear&quot;; also known as the '''Great Bear''' and '''Charles' Wain'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|Charles's Wain}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[constellation]] visible throughout the year in most of the [[northern hemisphere]]. It can be seen best in the month of April. It is dominated by the widely recognized [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the [[Big Dipper]] or the Plough, which is a useful pointer towards the north, and it has mythological significance in numerous world cultures.

==Asterisms==
{{Main|Big Dipper}}

The seven brightest [[star]]s of Ursa Major form the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the Big Dipper in the United States and Canada, the Plough in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the Saptarshi in India.

Another asterism known as the &quot;Three Leaps of Gazelle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursa Major &amp; Ursa Minor|url=http://my.execpc.com/60/B3/culp/astronomy/Winter/Bears.html|work=Winter Sky Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is recognized in [[Arab culture]], a series of three pairs of stars:
* [[Nu Ursae Majoris|ν]] and [[Xi Ursae Majoris|ξ]] Ursae Majoris, [[Alula Borealis]] and [[Alula Australis|Australis]], the &quot;first leap&quot;;
* [[Lambda Ursae Majoris|λ]] and [[Mu Ursae Majoris|μ]] Ursae Majoris, [[Tania Borealis]] and [[Tania Australis|Australis]], the &quot;second leap&quot;;
* [[Iota Ursae Majoris|ι]] and [[Kappa Ursae Majoris|κ]] Ursae Majoris, [[Talitha Borealis]] and [[Talitha Australis|Australis]], the &quot;third leap&quot;.
These stars are found along the southwest border of the constellation.

==Notable features==
[[Image:UrsaMajorCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Ursa Major as it can be seen by the unaided eye.]]

===Stars===
The &quot;[[Big Dipper]]&quot; (or &quot;Plough&quot;) [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within Ursa Major is made up of seven bright stars that together comprise one of the best-known patterns in the sky, while also forming the hindquarters and tail of the Great Bear.  Starting with the &quot;ladle&quot; portion of the dipper and extending clockwise through the handle, these stars are the following:

* [[Alpha Ursae Majoris|α Ursae Majoris]], known by the Arabic name [[Dubhe]] (&quot;the bear&quot;), which at a magnitude of 1.79 is the 35th brightest star in the sky and the second brightest of Ursa Major.
* [[Beta Ursae Majoris|β Ursae Majoris]], called Merak (&quot;the loins of the bear&quot;), with a magnitude of 2.37.
* [[Gamma Ursae Majoris|γ Ursae Majoris]], or [[Phecda]] (&quot;thigh&quot;), with a magnitude of 2.44.
* [[Delta Ursae Majoris|δ Ursae Majoris]], or [[Megrez]], meaning &quot;root of the tail,&quot; an appropriate name given its location as the intersection of the body and tail of the bear (or the ladle and handle of the dipper).
* [[Epsilon Ursae Majoris|ε Ursae Majoris]], known as [[Alioth]], a name which refers not to a bear but to a &quot;black horse,&quot; the name corrupted from the original and mis-assigned to the similarly named [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]], the naked-eye binary companion of [[Mizar (star)|Mizar]].&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Jim Kaler, Stars: &quot;Alioth&quot; (9/16/2009), http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/alioth.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Alioth is the brightest star of Ursa Major and the 33rd brightest in the sky, with a magnitude of 1.76. It is also the brightest of the &quot;peculiar A (Ap) stars,&quot; magnetic stars whose chemical elements are either depleted or enhanced, and appear to change as the star rotates.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaler.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zeta Ursae Majoris|ζ Ursae Majoris]], [[Mizar (star)|Mizar]], the second star in from the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, and the constellation's fourth brightest star. Mizar, which means &quot;girdle,&quot; forms a famous [[double star]], with its optical companion [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]] (80 Ursae Majoris), the two of which were termed the &quot;horse and rider&quot; by the Arabs. 
* [[Eta Ursae Majoris|η Ursae Majoris]], known as either [[Alkaid]] or [[Benetnash]], both meaning the &quot;end of the tail.&quot;  With a magnitude of 1.85, Alkaid is the third-brightest star of Ursa Major.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 195 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath, at p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for [[Dubhe]] and Alkaid ([[Eta Ursae Majoris]]), the stars of the Big Dipper all have [[proper motion]]s heading toward a common point in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. A few other such stars have been identified, and together they are called the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]].

The stars [[Beta Ursae Majoris|Merak]] (β Ursae Majoris) and [[Dubhe]] (α Ursae Majoris) are known as the &quot;pointer stars&quot; because they are helpful for finding [[Polaris]], also known as the [[North Star]] or Pole Star. By visually tracing a line from Merak through Dubhe and continuing, one's eye will land on Polaris, accurately indicating true north.

[[W Ursae Majoris]] is the prototype of a class of [[contact binary]] [[variable star]]s, and ranges between 7.75&lt;sup&gt;[[apparent magnitude|m]]&lt;/sup&gt; and 8.48&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.

Several bright [[galaxies]] are found in Ursa Major, including the pair [[Messier 81]] (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and [[Messier 82]] above the bear's head, and [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (M101), a spiral northeast of [[Eta Ursae Majoris|η Ursae Majoris]]. The [[spiral galaxies]] [[Messier 108]] and [[Messier 109]] are also found in this constellation. The bright [[planetary nebula]] [[Owl Nebula]] (M97) can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper.

[[Messier 81|M81]] is a nearly face-on [[spiral galaxy]] 11.8 million light-years from Earth. Like most spiral galaxies, it has a core made up of old stars, with arms filled with young stars and [[nebula]]e. Along with [[Messier 82|M82]], it is a part of the [[galaxy cluster]] closest to the [[Local Group]]. 

[[Messier 82|M82]] is a galaxy that is [[galaxy merger|interacting gravitationally]] with M81. It is the brightest [[infrared spectrum|infrared galaxy]] in the sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SN 2014J]], an apparent [[Type Ia supernova]], was observed in M82 on 21 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=5786&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messier 97|M97]], also called the Owl Nebula, is a [[planetary nebula]] 1,630 light-years from Earth; it has a magnitude of approximately 10.  It was discovered in 1781 by [[Pierre Méchain]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=129–130}}

[[Messier 101|M101]], also called the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a face-on [[spiral galaxy]] located 25 million light-years from Earth. It was discovered by [[Pierre Méchain]] in 1781. Its spiral arms have regions with extensive [[star formation]] and have strong [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet emissions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; It has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 7.5, making it visible in both binoculars and telescopes, but not to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = M101: A Bear of a Galaxy |last = Seronik |first = Gary |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = July 2012 |volume = 124 |issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGC 2787]] is a [[lenticular galaxy]] at a distance of 24 million light-years. Unlike most [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular galaxies]], NGC 2787 has a [[barred spiral galaxy|bar]] at its center. It also has a halo of [[globular cluster]]s, indicating its age and relative stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 3079]] is a [[starburst galaxy|starburst]] spiral galaxy located 52 million light-years from Earth. It has a horseshoe-shaped structure at its center that indicates the presence of a [[supermassive black hole]]. The structure itself is formed by [[superwind]]s from the black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 3310]] is another starburst spiral galaxy located 50 million light-years from Earth. Its bright white color is caused by its higher than usual rate of star formation, which began 100 million years ago after a merger. Studies of this and other starburst galaxies have shown that their starburst phase can last for hundreds of millions of years, far longer than was previously assumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[NGC 4013]] is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 55 million light-years from Earth. It has a prominent [[dust lane]] and has several visible star forming regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

[[I Zwicky 18]] is a young dwarf galaxy at a distance of 45 million light-years. The youngest known galaxy in the visible universe, I Zwicky 18 is about 4 million years old, about one-thousandth the age of the [[Solar System]]. It is filled with star forming regions which are creating many hot, young, blue stars at a very high rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

The [[Hubble Deep Field]] is located to the northeast of [[Delta Ursae Majoris|δ Ursae Majoris]].

===Meteor showers===
The [[Kappa Ursae Majorids]] are a newly discovered [[meteor shower]], peaking between November 1 and November 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 23 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extrasolar planets ===
[[HD 80606]], a sun-like star in a binary system, orbits a common center of gravity with its partner, [[HD 80607]]; the two are separated by 1,200 AU on average. Research conducted in 2003 indicates that its sole planet, [[HD 80606 b]] is a future [[hot Jupiter]], modeled to have evolved in a perpendicular orbit around 5 AU from its sun. The 4-Jupiter mass planet is projected to eventually move into a circular, more aligned orbit via the [[Kozai mechanism]]. However, it is currently on an incredibly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] that ranges from approximately one astronomical unit at its [[apoapsis]] and six stellar radii at [[periapsis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = How Worlds Get Out of Whack |first = Greg |last = Laughlin |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = May 2013 |page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the 48 constellations listed  by the 2nd century AD astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. It is mentioned by such poets as [[Homer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]. The Finnish epic [[Kalevala]] mentions it,  [[Vincent van Gogh]] painted it, and [[Federico Garcia Lorca]] mentions in his poem &quot;Song for the Moon&quot; written August 1920. In 2009, the American rock band [[Third Eye Blind]] named their fourth album, ''Ursa Major'', after the constellation.

==Mythology==
The constellation of Ursa Major has been seen as a [[bear]] by many distinct civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gibbon |first=William B. |title=Asiatic parallels in North American star lore: Ursa Major |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=77 |issue=305 |pages=236–250 |year=1964 |doi=10.2307/537746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may stem from a common [[oral tradition]] stretching back more than 13,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley E Schaefer, ''The Origin of the Greek Constellations: Was the Great Bear constellation named before hunter nomads first reached the Americas more than 13,000 years ago?'', [[Scientific American]], November 2006, reviewed at  [http://www.worldhistoryblog.com/2006/10/origin-of-greek-constellations.html The Origin of the Greek Constellations]; Yuri Berezkin,  [http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol31/berezkin.pdf The cosmic hunt: variants of a Siberian – North-American myth]. ''Folklore'', 31, 2005: 79-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Using statistical and phylogenetic tools, Julien d'Huy reconstructs the following Palaeolithic state of the story: &quot;There is an animal that is a horned herbivore, especially an elk. One human pursues this ungulate. The hunt locates or get to the sky. The animal is alive when it is transformed into a constellation. It forms the Big Dipper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy Julien, [http://www.academia.edu/3226058/Un_ours_dans_les_etoiles_recherche_phylogenetique_sur_un_mythe_prehistorique._-_Prehistoire_du_sud-ouest_20_1_2012_91-106 Un ours dans les étoiles: recherche phylogénétique sur un mythe préhistorique], ''Préhistoire du sud-ouest'', 20 (1), 2012: 91-106; [http://www.academia.edu/3045718/PREPRINT_A_Cosmic_Hunt_in_the_Berber_sky_a_phylogenetic_reconstruction_of_Palaeolithic_mythology._Les_Cahiers_de_lAARS_15_2012_ A Cosmic Hunt in the Berber sky : a phylogenetic reconstruction of Palaeolithic mythology], ''Les Cahiers de l'AARS'', 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''Pucwan Tārā'' (pronounced &quot;bazun taja&quot;) is the name of a constellation comprising stars from the head and forelegs of Ursa Major; ''pucwan'' is a general term for a [[crustacean]], such as [[prawn]], [[shrimp]], [[crab]], [[lobster]], etc.

In [[Greek mythology]], Zeus (the king of the gods) lusts after a young woman named [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], a [[nymph]] of [[Artemis]]. [[Hera]], Zeus' jealous wife, transforms the beautiful Callisto into a bear. Callisto, while in bear form, later encounters her son [[Arcas]]. Arcas almost shoots the bear, but to avert the tragedy, Zeus turns them into bears and puts them in the sky, forming Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.  Callisto is Ursa Major and her son, Arcas, is Ursa Minor.  In ancient times the name of the constellation was Helike, (&quot;turning&quot;), because it turns around the Pole.   In Book Two of [[Lucan]] it is called Parrhasian Helice, since Callisto came from [[Parrhasia]] in [[Arcadia]], where the story is set.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edith ''Mythology'' New American Library, New York, 1942, chapter 21 (Callisto).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Odyssey]] notes that it is the sole constellation that never sinks below the horizon and &quot;bathes in the Ocean's waves&quot;, so it is used as a celestial reference point for [[History of navigation#Antiquity|navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 book 5, 273]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the &quot;Wain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mandelbaum |first = Allen; translator |title = The Odyssey of Homer |publisher = Bantam Dell |location = New York City |year = 1990 |isbn = 0-553-21399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few star groups mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Job 9:9; 38:32; — [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Pleiades]] being others), Ursa Major was also pictured as a bear by the [[Jew]]ish peoples. (&quot;The Bear&quot; was translated as &quot;Arcturus&quot; in the [[Vulgate]] and it persisted in the [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]].)

In [[Finnish language]], the asterism is sometimes called with its old Finnish name, [[Big Dipper|Otava]]. The meaning of the name has been almost forgotten in Modern Finnish; it means a [[salmon]] [[fishing weir|weir]].

The [[Iroquois]] [[Native Americans in Canada|Native Americans]] interpreted Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid as three hunters pursuing the Great Bear. According to one version of their myth, the first hunter (Alioth) is carrying a bow and arrow to strike down the bear. The second hunter (Mizar) carries a large pot — the star Alcor — on his shoulder in which to cook the bear while the third hunter (Alkaid) hauls a pile of firewood to light a fire beneath the pot.

In [[Hinduism]], Ursa Major is known as [[Saptarshi]], each of the stars representing one of the Saptarshis or Seven Sages viz. Bhrigu, Atri, Angirasa, Vasishta, Pulastya, Pulalaha and Kratu. The fact that the two front stars of the constellations point to the pole star 
is explained as the boon given to the boy sage Dhruva by [[Lord Vishnu]].

In [[Javanese language|Javanese]], as known as &quot;Bintang Kartika&quot;. This name comes from [[Sanskrit]] which refers &quot;krttikã&quot; the same star cluster. In ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] this brightest seven stars are known as ''Lintang Wuluh'', literally means &quot;seven stars&quot;.
This star clusters so popular because its emergence into the start time marker for planting.

In [[South Korea]], the constellation is referred to as &quot;the seven stars of the north&quot;. In the related myth, a widow with seven sons found comfort with a widower, but to get to his house required crossing a stream. The seven sons, sympathetic to their mother, placed stepping stones in the river. Their mother, not knowing who put the stones in place, blessed them and, when they died, they became the constellation.

In [[Shinto]], the 7 largest stars of Ursa Major belong to [[Amenominakanushi]], the oldest and most powerful of all kami.

In [[Theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the Pleiades'' focus the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the Great Bear'', then to [[Sirius]], then to the [[Sun]], then to the god of [[Earth]] ([[Sanat Kumara]]), and finally through the seven [[ascended master|Masters of the Seven Rays]] to the [[human race]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Baker|Baker, Dr. Douglas]] ''The Seven Rays:Key to the Mysteries'' 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic visualisation==

In European star charts, the constellation was visualized with the 'square' of the Big Dipper forming the bear's body and the chain of stars forming the Dipper's &quot;handle&quot; as a long tail. However, bears do not have long tails, and Jewish astronomers considered Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid instead to be either three cubs following their mother, and the Native Americans as three hunters.

Noted children's book author [[H. A. Rey]], in his 1952 book ''The Stars: A New Way to See Them,'' (ISBN 0-395-24830-2) instead had the &quot;bear&quot; image of the constellation, much as Johannes Hevelius had done (as far as the figure of the bear facing &quot;left&quot;), oriented with Alkaid as [http://gophineas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rey_ursa_major.jpg the tip of the bear's nose], and the &quot;handle&quot; of the Big Dipper part of the constellation forming the outline of the top of the bear's head and neck, rearwards to the shoulder. Because of Rey's book, many amateur astronomers{{Who|date=May 2009}} have come to accept Rey's star chart interpretation of Ursa Major,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} dropping the idea of the Big Dipper's &quot;handle&quot; as being the hind end of the bear, with a non-natural &quot;tail&quot; extending rearwards.

Ursa Major is also pictured as the [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]], the Irish Flag of Labour, adopted by [[James Connolly]]'s [[Irish Citizen Army]] in 1916, which shows the constellation on a blue background, and on the state flag of [[Alaska]].

===Stars===
Lupus has around 30 [[star|stars]] of 2nd and 3rd [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] and 70 of greater than 6th, including a number of [[binary star|binary]] or [[multiple star]]s. In his [[star catalogue|catalogue]], [[Patrick Moore]] gives the [[Proper names (astronomy)|names]] ''Men'' for [[Alpha Lupi|α Lupi]], the brightest star in Lupus, and ''KeKouan'' for the [[blue giant]] [[Beta Lupi|β Lupi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Most of the brightest stars in Lupus are massive members of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association|Scorpius-Centaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Nearest OB Association: Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco OB2)|author=Preibisch, T., Mamajek, E.|year=2008|journal=Handbook of Star-Forming Regions|volume=2|pages=0|bibcode=2008hsf2.book..235P|arxiv=0809.0407|last2=Mamajek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
Towards the north of the constellation are [[globular cluster]]s [[NGC 5824]] and [[NGC 5986]], and close by the dark [[nebula]] [[B 228]]. To the south are two [[open cluster]]s, [[NGC 5822]] and [[NGC 5749]], as well as [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 5927]] on the eastern border with [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]].  On the western border are two [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] and the [[Wolf-Rayet star|Wolf-Rayet]] [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 4406]], containing some of the hottest stars in existence. IC 4406, also called the Retina Nebula, is a cylindrical nebula at a distance of 5,000 light-years. It  has [[dust lanes]] throughout its center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another planetary nebula, [[NGC 5882]], is towards the centre of the constellation. The transiting exoplanet [[Lupus-TR-3b]] lies in this constellation. The historic supernova [[SN 1006]] is described by various sources as appearing on April 30 to May 1, 1006, in the constellation of Lupus.

[[ESO 274-1]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] seen from edge-on that requires an amateur telescope with at least 12 inches of aperture to view. It can be found by using [[Lambda Lupi]] and [[Mu Lupi]] as markers, and can only be seen under very dark skies. It is 9 arcminutes by 0.7 arcminutes with a small, elliptical nucleus.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}}

==Mythology and history==
In ancient times, the constellation was considered an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within [[Centaurus]], and was considered to have been an arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 160 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative visualization, attested by [[Eratosthenes]], saw this constellation as a wineskin held by Centaurus.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not separated from Centaurus until [[Hipparchus]] of [[Bithynia]] named it ''Therion'' (meaning beast) in the 200s BC. No particular animal was associated with it until the Latin translation of Ptolemy's work identified it with the wolf.

The Greek constellation is probably based on the Babylonian figure known as the Mad Dog (UR.IDIM). This was a strange hybrid creature that combined the head and torso of a man with the legs and tail of a lion (the cuneiform sign 'UR' simply refers to a large carnivore; lions, wolves and  dogs are all included). It is often found in association with the sun god and another mythical being called the Bison-man, which is supposedly related to the Greek constellation of Centaurus.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 145 &amp; 59ff&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">[[File:Constellations ecliptic equirectangular plot.svg|right|300px|thumb|The First Point of Aries defines the coordinate (0°, 0°). It on is the [[celestial equator]] at both the left and right extremes of the celestial chart, with the [[ecliptic]] (the orange dotted sine curve) passing through it.]]

The '''First Point of Aries''' is the location of the [[vernal equinox]], and is named for the constellation of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]]. It is one of the two points on the [[celestial sphere]] at which the [[celestial equator]] meets the [[ecliptic plane]], the other being the First Point of Libra, located exactly 180° from it. Over its year-long journey through the constellations, the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north at the First Point of Aries, and from north to south at the First Point of Libra. The First Point of Aries is considered to be the celestial &quot;[[prime meridian]]&quot; from which [[right ascension]]s are calculated.

The First Point of Aries (also known as the Cusp of Aries) is so called because, when [[Hipparchus]] defined it in 130 BCE, it was located in the eastern extreme of the constellation of Aries, near its border with [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and the star [[Gamma Arietis|γ Arietis]]. Due to the [[Sun]]'s westward movement across the sky throughout the year, this eastern end of Aries was the point at which the Sun entered the constellation, hence the name ''First Point'' of Aries.

Due to Earth's [[axial precession]], this point gradually moves eastwards at a rate of about one degree every 72 years. This means that, since the time of Hipparchus, it has shifted across the sky by about 30°, and is currently located within Pisces, near its border with [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. Currently, the closest major star to the First Point of Aries is [[Lambda Piscium|λ Piscium]], located at ({{RA|22|52|37}}, {{DEC|−07|34|47}}).

The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}

The Cusp of Aries is important to the fields of astronomy, nautical navigation and astrology. [[Nautical almanac|Navigational ephemeris tables]] record the geographic position of the First Point of Aries as the reference for position of navigational stars. Due to the [[Precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], the [[astrological signs]] of the [[tropical zodiac]] are likewise identically affected and thus also no longer correspond with the actual [[constellation]]s once ascribed to them (with the Cusp of Libra now actually located within [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]), and is the basis for the concept of [[astrological age]]s. In [[sidereal astrology]] (notably [[Hindu astrology]]), by contrast, the first point of Aries remains aligned with [[Ras Hammel]] &quot;the head of the ram&quot;, i.e. the [[Aries (constellation)|Aries constellation]].)

==This year in 2014==
The First Point of Aries ♈ is March 20 2014 16:57 GMT, or 240°57'?&quot; = -119.05°, a [[Meridian (geography)|Meridian]] just E of Santa Barbara, CA USA. [[Hour_angle#Sidereal_hour_angle|SHA]] there an hour before ♈ is 15°.

'''Capricornus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|p|r|ɨ|ˈ|k|ɔr|n|ə|s}} is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]; it is often called '''Capricorn''', especially when referring to the corresponding [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;horned [[goat]]&quot; or &quot;goat [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]&quot;, and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half [[fish]]. Its symbol is [[Image:Capricorn symbol 2.png|20px]] (Unicode ♑).

Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Microscopium]], [[Piscis Austrinus]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus. It is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], and it is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.

==Notable features==
[[Image:CapricornusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Capricornus as it can be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/capricornus.html |title=Capricornus, the Goat - Constellations - Digital Images of the Sky |publisher=Allthesky.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Capricornus and Aquarius.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Capricornus (right) and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] (left). The brightest object of the picture is [[Jupiter]].]]

===Deep-sky objects===
Several galaxies and star clusters are contained within Capricornus.  [[Messier 30]] is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907. 

[[Messier 30|M30]] (NGC 7099) is a centrally-condensed globular cluster of magnitude 7.5. At a distance of 30,000 light-years, it has chains of stars extending to the north that are resolvable in small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

One [[galaxy group]] located in Capricornus is [[HCG 87]], a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million [[light-years]] from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0296). It contains a large [[elliptical galaxy]], a face-on [[spiral galaxy]], and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of [[star formation]], indicating that it is [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have [[active galactic nucleus|active nuclei]], are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may [[galaxy merger|merge]] millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars===
Capricorn is a faint constellation, with only one star above magnitude 3; its [[Bayer designation|alpha star]] has a magnitude of only 3.6.

The brightest star in Capricornus is [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]], also called Deneb Algedi, with a magnitude of 2.9, 39 light-years from Earth. Like several other stars such as [[Denebola]] and [[Deneb]], it is named for the Arabic word for &quot;tail&quot; (''deneb''); its traditional name means &quot;the tail of the goat&quot;. Deneb Algedi is a [[Beta Lyrae variable]] star (a type of [[eclipsing binary]]). It ranges by about 0.2 magnitudes with a period of 24.5 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

The other bright stars in Capricornus range in magnitude from 3.1 to 5.1. [[Alpha Capricorni|α Capricorni]] is a multiple star also known as Algedi or Giedi. The primary (α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Cap), 109 light-years from Earth,  is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6.; the secondary (α&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Cap), 690 light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3. The two stars are distinguishable by the naked eye, and both are themselves multiple stars. α&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Capricorni is accompanied by a star of magnitude 9.2; α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Capricornus is accompanied by a star of magnitude 11.0; this faint star is itself a binary star with two components of magnitude 11. The traditional names of α Capricorni come from the Arabic word for &quot;the kid&quot;, which references the constellation's mythology.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

[[Beta Capricorni|β Capricorni]] is a [[double star]] also known as Dabih. It is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 340 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.1. The two stars are distinguishable in binoculars. [[Beta Capricorni|β Capricorni]]'s traditional name comes from the Arabic phrase for &quot;the lucky stars of the slaughterer,&quot; a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient Arabs at the [[heliacal rising]] of Capricornus.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 126 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).&lt;/ref&gt; Another star visible to the naked eye is [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Capricorni]], sometimes called Nashira (&quot;bringing good tidings&quot;); it is a white-hued giant star of magnitude 3.7, 139 light-years from Earth. [[Pi Capricorni|π Capricorni]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.1 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.3. It is 670 light-years from Earth and the components are distinguishable in a small telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

==History and mythology==
Despite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] of a goat and a fish since the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. First attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Master's Thesis |first = Peeter |last = Espak |year = 2006 |page = 104 |url = http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/10062/958/5/espakpeeter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was explicitly recorded in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] as {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;SUḪUR.MAŠ}} &quot;The Goat-Fish&quot; before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of the god [[Ea (god)|Ea]] and in the [[Early Bronze Age]] marked the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = John H. |last = Rogers, |url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R |title = Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions |journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume = 108 |year = 1998 |pages = 9–28|bibcode = 1998JBAA..108....9R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, but the [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign called Capricorn]] begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

In Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes identified as [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], the goat that suckled the infant [[Zeus]] after his mother [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] saved him from being devoured by his father [[Cronus|Cronos]] (in [[Greek mythology]]). The goat's broken horn was transformed into the [[cornucopia]] or horn of plenty.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Capricornus is also sometimes identified as [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god with a goat's head, who saved himself from the monster [[Typhon]] by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

The planet [[Neptune]] was discovered in Capricornus by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]], near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is appropriate as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September.

==Visualizations==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Capricornus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Capricornus as a sea-goat from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
Capricornus's brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Capricorni]] (Giedi), [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]] (Deneb Algiedi), and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Capricorni]]. Ptolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jebrown.us/SolarAlmanac/private/Articles/Constellations/Capricornus.html#Ptolemy |title=Capricornus |publisher=Jebrown.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capricornus is usually drawn as a goat with the tail of a fish.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

[[Image:Capricornus constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of H.A. Rey's alternative way to connect the stars of the Capricornus constellation.]]
[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a [[goat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rey|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars [[Iota Capricorni|ι Cap]], [[Theta Capricorni|θ Cap]], and [[Zeta Capricorni|ζ Cap]]. The goat's horn sticks out with stars [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Cap]] and [[Delta Capricorni|δ Cap]]. Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars [[Beta Capricorni|β Cap]] and [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Cap]]: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars [[Psi Capricorni|ψ Cap]] and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Cap]]. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Capricornus lies in ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|The Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').

The [[Nakh peoples]] called this constellation Roofing Towers ({{lang-ce|Neģara Bjovnaš}}).

In the [[Society Islands]], the figure of Capricornus was called ''Rua-o-Mere'', &quot;Cavern of parental yearnings&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=251}}

==Astrology==
{{main|Capricorn (astrology)}}

{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Capricornus from January 19 to February 15. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Capricornus (astrology)|Capricorn]] from December 22 to January 20, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from January 15 to February 15.

'''Andromeda''' is one of the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd-century [[Greek astronomy|Greco-Roman]] astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and remains one of the [[List of constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Located north of the [[celestial equator]], it is named for [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia]], in the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], along with several other constellations named for characters in the [[Perseus]] myth. Because of its northern [[declination]], Andromeda is only visible north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It is one of the largest constellations, with an area of 722 [[square degree]]s. This is over 1,400 times the size of the [[full moon]], 55% of the size of the largest constellation, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, [[Crux]].

Its brightest star, [[Alpha Andromedae]], is a [[binary star]] that has also been counted as a part of [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], while [[Gamma Andromedae]] is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, [[Beta Andromedae]] is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye [[Andromeda Galaxy]] (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest [[Messier object]]s. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions [[Messier 110|M110]] and [[Messier 32|M32]], as well as the more distant [[NGC 891]], lie within Andromeda. The [[Blue Snowball Nebula]], a [[planetary nebula]], is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that make up Andromeda were members of four different constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology. Andromeda is the location of the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] for the [[Andromedids]], a weak [[meteor shower]] that occurs in November.

== History and mythology ==

[[File:Andromeda Hevelius.jpg|thumb|border|250px|left|[[Johannes Hevelius]]'s depiction of Andromeda, from the 1690 edition of his ''Uranographia''. As was conventional for [[celestial atlas]]es of the time, the constellation is a mirror image of modern maps as it was drawn from a perspective outside the [[celestial sphere]].]]
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Gloria Frederici, Andromeda, and Triangula.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Andromeda as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.&amp;nbsp;1825, showing the constellation from the inside of the celestial sphere]]
[[File:AndromedaCC.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Photo of the constellation Andromeda, as it appears to the naked eye. Lines have been added for clarity.]]

The [[uranography]] of Andromeda has its roots most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's location had appeared earlier in [[Babylonian astronomy]]. The stars that make up [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a [[fertility goddess]], sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mediterranean Traditions''|1998}}

Andromeda is known as &quot;the Chained Lady&quot; or &quot;the Chained Woman&quot; in English. It was known as ''Mulier Catenata'' (&quot;chained woman&quot;) in [[Latin]] and ''al-Mar'at al Musalsalah'' in [[Arabic]].{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=32–33}} It has also been called ''Persea'' (&quot;Perseus's wife&quot;) or ''Cepheis'' (&quot;Cepheus's daughter&quot;),{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=22–23}} all names that refer to Andromeda's role in the Greco-Roman myth of Perseus, in which [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], the queen of [[Ethiopia]], bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the [[Nereid]]s, sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=116–117}} Offended at her remark, the nymphs petitioned [[Poseidon]] to punish Cassiopeia for her insolence, which he did by commanding the sea monster [[Cetus]] to attack Ethiopia.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=116–117}} Andromeda's panicked father, [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]], was told by the Oracle of Ammon that the only way to save his kingdom was to sacrifice his daughter to Cetus.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Andromeda}}&lt;!-- The previous few sentences are covered by Thompson and Ridpath, including the sentences also cited to Moore. --&gt; She was chained to a rock by the sea but was saved by the hero [[Perseus]], who used the head of [[Medusa]] to turn the monster into stone;{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=132}} [[Algol]] (β Persei), the &quot;Demon Star&quot;, marks the head of Medusa.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}} Perseus and Andromeda then married; the myth recounts that the couple had nine children together&amp;nbsp;– seven sons and two daughter&amp;nbsp;– and founded [[Mycenae]] and its Persideae dynasty. After Andromeda's death [[Athena]] placed her in the sky as a constellation, to honor her. Several of the neighboring constellations ([[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], [[Cetus]], and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]]) also represent characters in the Perseus myth.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} It is connected with the constellation Pegasus.

Andromeda was one of the original 48 [[constellation]]s formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in his 2nd-century [[Almagest]], in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars. She is typically depicted with α Andromedae as her head, ο and λ Andromedae as her chains, and δ, π, μ, Β, and γ Andromedae representing her body and legs. However, there is no universal depiction of Andromeda and the stars used to represent her body, head, and chains.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=7–14, 17}} Arab astronomers were aware of Ptolemy's constellations, but they included a second constellation representing a fish at Andromeda's feet.{{sfn|Davis|1944}} Several stars from Andromeda and most of the stars in [[Lacerta]] were combined in 1787 by German astronomer [[Johann Bode]] to form [[Frederici Honores]] (also called Friedrichs Ehre). It was designed to honor [[Frederick the Great|King Frederick II of Prussia]], but quickly fell into disuse.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=43}} Since the time of Ptolemy, Andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]], although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both Ptolemy's pattern and the surrounding stars.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=128–129}} In 1922, the IAU defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, &quot;And&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|1922|pp=469–471}} The official boundaries of Andromeda were defined in 1930 by [[Eugène Delporte]] as a polygon of 36 segments. Its [[right ascension]] is between 22&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 57.5&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 39.3&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[declination]] is between 53.19° and 21.68° in the [[equatorial coordinate system]].{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Andromeda}}

=== In non-Western astronomy ===

{{contains Chinese text|section}}

In traditional [[Chinese astronomy]], nine stars from Andromeda (including Beta Andromedae, Mu Andromedae, and Nu Andromedae), along with seven stars from Pisces, formed an elliptical constellation called &quot;[[Legs (Chinese constellation)|Legs]]&quot; (奎宿). This constellation either represented the foot of a walking person or a wild boar.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Andromeda}} [[Gamma Andromedae]] and its neighbors were called &quot;[[Teen Ta Tseang Keun]]&quot; (天大将军, heaven's great general), representing honor in astrology and a great general in mythology.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Andromeda}} [[Alpha Andromedae]] and [[Gamma Pegasi]] together made &quot;[[Wall (Chinese constellation)|Wall]]&quot; (壁宿), representing the eastern wall of the imperial palace and/or the emperor's personal library. For the Chinese, the northern swath of Andromeda formed a stable for changing horses (''tianjiu'', 天厩, stable on sky) and the far western part, along with most of [[Lacerta]], became Tengshe, a flying snake.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Andromeda}}

An Arab constellation called &quot;al-Hut&quot; (the fish) was composed of several stars in Andromeda, M31, and several stars in Pisces. [[Nu Andromedae|ν And]], [[Mu Andromedae|μ And]], [[Beta Andromedae|β And]], [[Eta Andromedae|η And]], [[Zeta Andromedae|ζ And]], [[Epsilon Andromedae|ε And]], [[Delta Andromedae|δ And]], [[Pi Andromedae|π And]], and [[32 Andromedae|32 And]] were all included from Andromeda; [[Nu Piscium|ν Psc]], [[Phi Piscium|φ Psc]], [[Chi Piscium|χ Psc]], and [[Psi Piscium|ψ Psc]] were included from Pisces.{{sfn|Davis|1944}}

Hindu legends surrounding Andromeda are similar to the Greek myths. Ancient Sanskrit texts depict Antarmada chained to a rock, as in the Greek myth. Scholars believe that the Hindu and Greek astrological myths were closely linked; one piece of evidence cited is the similarity between the names &quot;Antarmada&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=22–23}}

Andromeda is also associated with the [[Mesopotamia]]n creation story of [[Tiamat]], the goddess of Chaos. She bore many demons for her husband, [[Apsu]], but eventually decided to destroy them in a war that ended when [[Marduk]] killed her. He used her body to create the constellations as markers of time for humans.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=7–14, 17}}

In the [[Marshall Islands]], Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Triangulum, and Aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a [[porpoise]]. Andromeda's bright stars are mostly in the body of the porpoise; Cassiopeia represents its tail and Aries its head.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=7–14, 17}} In the [[Tuamotu]] islands, Alpha Andromedae was called ''Takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki'', meaning &quot;Star of the wearisome toil&quot;,{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=255}} and Beta Andromedae was called ''Piringa-o-Tautu''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=279}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

[[File:M31bobo.jpg|thumb|border|400px|right|M31, the Great Galaxy of Andromeda.]]

The constellation of Andromeda lies well away from the [[galactic plane]], so it does not contain any of the [[open cluster]]s or bright [[nebula]]e of the Milky Way. Because of its distance in the sky from the band of obscuring dust, gas, and abundant stars of our home galaxy, Andromeda's borders contain many visible distant galaxies.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} The most famous [[deep-sky object]] in Andromeda is the [[spiral galaxy]] cataloged as Messier 31 (M31) or NGC 224 but known colloquially as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]  for the constellation.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=244}} M31 is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye, 2.2&amp;nbsp;million light-years from Earth (estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years);{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} it is seen under a dark, transparent sky as a hazy patch in the north of the constellation.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} M31 is the largest neighboring galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=244}}{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} In absolute terms, M31 is approximately 200,000 light-years in diameter, twice the size of the Milky Way.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} It is an enormous&amp;nbsp;– 192.4 by 62.2 arcminutes in [[apparent size]]{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}&amp;nbsp;– [[barred spiral galaxy]] similar in form to the Milky Way and at an approximate magnitude of 3.5, is one of the brightest deep-sky objects in the northern sky.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=51}} Despite being visible to the naked eye, the &quot;little cloud&quot; near Andromeda's figure was not recorded until 964 C.E., when the Arab astronomer [[al-Sufi]] wrote his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Andromeda}}{{sfn|Higgins|2002}} M31 was first observed telescopically shortly after its invention, by [[Simon Marius]] in 1612.{{sfn|Rao|2011}}

M31 is often referred to as a twin sister to the Milky Way, but it has only half the mass of the Milky Way despite being twice its diameter.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} The futures of the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies may be interlinked: in about five billion years, the two could potentially begin an [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision]] that would spark extensive new star formation.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}}

American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] included M31 (then known as the Andromeda Nebula) in his groundbreaking 1923 research on galaxies.{{sfn|Higgins|2002}} Using the 100-inch [[Hooker Telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in California, he observed [[Cepheid variable]] stars in M31 during a search for [[nova]]e, allowing him to determine their distance by using the stars as [[standard candle]]s.{{sfn|Hoskin|Dewhirst|1999|pp=292–296}} The distance he found was far greater than the size of the Milky Way, which led him to the conclusion that many similar objects were &quot;island universes&quot; on their own.{{sfn|ESA, ''Edwin Powell Hubble''}}{{sfn|PBS, ''Edwin Hubble''|1998}}{{sfn|HubbleSite, ''About Edwin Hubble''|2008}} Hubble originally estimated that the Andromeda Galaxy was 900,000 light-years away, but [[Ernst Öpik]]'s estimate in 1925 put the distance closer to 1.5 million light-years.{{sfn|Hoskin|Dewhirst|1999|pp=292–296}}

The Andromeda Galaxy's two main companions, [[Messier 32|M32]] and [[Messier 110|M110]] (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint elliptical galaxies that lie near it.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=244}} M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} compared to M110, appears superimposed on the larger galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy;{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=244}} M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=72–74}} M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer [[Guillaume Le Gentil]] and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself.{{sfn|Block|2003}} It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} M110 is classified as either a [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy]] or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}

The Andromeda Galaxy has a total of 15 [[List of Andromeda's satellite galaxies|satellite galaxies]], including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused astronomers to infer that they have a common origin. These satellite galaxies, like the [[List of Milky Way's satellite galaxies|satellites of the Milky Way]], tend to be older, gas-poor [[dwarf elliptical galaxy|dwarf elliptical]] and [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy|dwarf spheroidal galaxies]].{{sfn|Koch|Grebel|2006}}

Along with the Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the constellation also features [[NGC 891]] (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy just east of [[gamma Andromedae|Almach]]. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}} as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates;{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}} NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of [[William Herschel|William]] and [[Caroline Herschel]] in August 1783.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}} This galaxy is at an approximate distance of 30 million light years from Earth, calculated from its [[redshift]] of 0.002.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|pp=348, 366}}

Andromeda's most celebrated [[open cluster]] is [[NGC 752]] ([[Caldwell Catalogue|Caldwell]] 28) at an overall magnitude of 5.7.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}} It is a loosely scattered cluster in the Milky Way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars, although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=72–74}} It is considered to be one of the more inconspicuous open clusters.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=116–117}} The other open cluster in Andromeda is [[NGC 7686]], which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the Milky Way. It contains approximately 20 stars in a diameter of 15 arcminutes, making it a tighter cluster than NGC 752.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}}

There is one prominent [[planetary nebula]] in Andromeda: [[NGC 7662]] (Caldwell 22).{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}} Lying approximately three degrees southwest of [[Iota Andromedae]] at a distance of about 4,000 light-years from Earth, the &quot;Blue Snowball Nebula&quot;{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}} is a popular target for amateur astronomers.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=270}} It earned its popular name because it appears as a faint, round, blue-green object in a telescope, with an overall magnitude of 9.2.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=270}} Upon further magnification, it is visible as a slightly elliptical annular disk that gets darker towards the center, with a magnitude 13.2 central star.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=66–73}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=72–74}} The nebula has an overall magnitude of 9.2 and is 20 by 130 arcseconds in size.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=328–330}}

=== Meteor showers ===

Each November, the [[Andromedids]] meteor shower appears to radiate from Andromeda.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=60}} The shower peaks in mid-to-late November every year, but has a low peak rate of fewer than two meteors per hour.{{sfn|Lunsford, ''Meteor Shower List''|2012}} Astronomers have often associated the Andromedids with [[Biela's Comet]], which was destroyed in the 19th century, but that connection is disputed.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2008}} Andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself is considered to be diffuse, as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as Andromeda itself.{{sfn|Lunsford, ''Activity Nov 19–23''|2011}} Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s.{{sfn|Sherrod|Koed|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|Vaubaillon|2007}} The Andromedids were associated with the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second (a [[zenithal hourly rate]] of 10,000), prompting one Chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2008}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=384}} The Andromedids had another outburst on December 3–5, 2011, the most active shower since 1885, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 50 meteors per hour. The 2011 outburst was linked to ejecta from Comet Biela, which passed close to the Sun in 1649. None of the meteoroids observed were associated with material from the comet's 1846 disintegration. The observers of the 2011 outburst predicted outbursts in 2018, 2023, and 2036.{{sfn|Wiegert|Brown|Weryk|Wong|2012}}

'''Cepheus''' is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky. It is named after [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

==History and mythology==
Cepheus was the [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|King]] of [[Aethiopia]]. He was married to [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]] and was the father of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

==Notable features==
[[Image:CepheusCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Cepheus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Stars===
[[Alpha Cephei]], traditionally called &quot;Alderamin&quot;, is a white hued star of magnitude 2.5, 49 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Cephei]], traditionally called &quot;Alfirk&quot;, is a double star with a blue-hued giant primary of [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] 3.2 and a secondary of magnitude 7.9. The primary is a [[variable star]] considered to be the prototype of [[Beta Cephei variable|its subclass]] of [[pulsating variable star]]s, which are sometimes named for [[Beta Canis Majoris]]. Beta Cephei variables do not have wide ranges in magnitude, nor do they have periods longer than a few hours. Beta Cephei itself varies 0.1 magnitudes every 4.6 hours. Its traditional name means &quot;flock&quot; and refers to a flock of sheep. [[Gamma Cephei]], traditionally called Errai, is an orange-hued star of magnitude 3.2, 45 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the shepherd&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=112-113}} It is a [[binary star]] approximately 50 light years away from Earth.  The system consists of an orange [[subgiant]] and a [[red dwarf]].  Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], γ Cephei will be the [[pole star]] between AD 3000 and [[6th millennium|5200]], with the closest approach to the celestial pole around AD 4000. The primary component is orbited by a [[extrasolar planet|planet]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Delta Cephei|δ Cephei]] is the prototype [[Cepheid variable]], a yellow-hued supergiant star 980 light-years from Earth. It was discovered to be [[variable star|variable]] by [[John Goodricke]] in 1784.  It varies between 3.5&lt;sup&gt;[[apparent magnitude|m]]&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.4&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; over a period of 5 days and 9 hours. The Cepheids are a class of [[pulsating variable stars]]; Delta Cephei has a minimum size of 40 [[solar diameter]]s and a maximum size of 46 solar diameters. It is also a [[double star]]; the yellow star also has a wide-set blue-hued companion of magnitude 6.3.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=112-113}}

There are several other prominent variable stars in Cepheus. One, [[Mu Cephei|μ Cephei]], is also known as Herschel's Garnet Star due to its deep red colour. It is a [[semiregular variable star]] with a minimum magnitude of 5.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.4. Its period is approximately 2 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=112-113}} The star is around 11.8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] in radius. If it were placed at the centre of our [[Solar System]], it would extend to the orbit of [[Saturn]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Another, [[VV Cephei]], like Mu Cephei, is a [[red supergiant]] and a semiregular variable star, located at least 2000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.8. One of the largest stars in the galaxy, it has a diameter of over 1000 solar diameters. VV Cephei is also an unusually long-period [[eclipsing binary]], but the eclipses, which occur every 20.3 years, are too faint to be observed with the unaided eye. [[T Cephei]], also a red giant, is a [[Mira variable]] with a minimum magnitude of 11.3 and a maximum magnitude of 5.2, 685 light-years from Earth. It has a period of 13 months and a diameter of 500 solar diameters.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=112-113}}

There are several prominent [[double star]]s and [[binary star]]s in Cepheus. [[Omicron Cephei]] is a binary star with a period of 800 years. The system, 211 light-years from Earth, consists of an orange-hued giant primary of magnitude 4.9 and a secondary of magnitude 7.1. [[Xi Cephei]] is another binary star, 102 light-years from Earth, with a period of 4000 years. It has a blue-white primary of magnitude 4.4 and a yellow secondary of magnitude 6.5.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=112-113}}

[[Kruger 60]] is an 11th magnitude binary star consisting of two red dwarfs. The star system is one of the nearest, being only 13 [[light year]]s away from Earth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Visualizations==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Cepheus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cepheus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c. 1825.]]
Cepheus is most commonly depicted as holding his arms aloft, praying for the gods to spare the life of Andromeda. He is also depicted as a more regal monarch sitting on his throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of the constellation [[Cepheus (Chinese astronomy)|Cepheus]] are found in two areas: the [[Purple Forbidden enclosure]] (紫微垣, ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'') and the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').

==In popular culture==
* In the TV sitcom ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', the aliens' home planet is stated to be located in a [[barred spiral galaxy]] on the Cepheus-[[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] border.
* The performer [[Deadmau5]] named his song, &quot;[[HR 8938 Cephei]]&quot; after a star in the constellation.

'''Canis Major''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|ər}} is a [[constellation]] in the [[Celestial sphere|southern celestial hemisphere]]. In the second century, it was included in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;greater dog&quot; in contrast to [[Canis Minor]], the &quot;lesser dog&quot;; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter. The [[Milky Way]] passes through Canis Major and several [[open cluster]]s lie within its borders.

Canis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the 'dog star'. It is bright because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high [[luminosity]]. At magnitude 1.5, [[Epsilon Canis Majoris]] (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the constellation and one of the brightest sources of ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]] (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] (Aludra) at 2.4 and [[Omicron1 Canis Majoris|Omicron&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary [[Zeta Canis Majoris|Zeta]] (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant [[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], while the [[neutron star]] [[RX J0720.4-3125]] has a radius of a mere 5&amp;nbsp;km.

== History and mythology ==
In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the [[Babylon]]ians, was seen as an arrow, aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of [[Puppis]] were viewed as a bow, named BAN, in the ''[[Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior [[Ninurta]], and the bow with [[Ishtar]], daughter of [[Enlil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions | journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume=108 |issue=1 | pages=9–28 | bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninurta was linked to the later deity [[Marduk]], who was said to have slain the ocean goddess [[Tiamat]] with a great bow, and was worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=71}} The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers1998a&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: II. The Mediterranean Traditions | journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume=108 | issue=2| pages=79–89 | bibcode=1998JBAA..108...79R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], a gift from [[Zeus]] to [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]; or sometimes the hound of [[Procris]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana's]] nymph; or the one given by [[Eos|Aurora]] to [[Cephalus]], so famed for its speed that [[Zeus]] elevated it to the sky.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} pursuing [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[Hare]] or helping Orion fight [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the Bull; and is referred to in this way by [[Aratus|Aratos]], [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] refer only to one dog, but by [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Canis Minor]] appears as Orion's second dog. Alternate names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]''.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}}

The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as ''Custos Europae'', the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the form of a bull; and as ''[[Cerberus|Janitor Lethaeus]]'', &quot;the watchdog&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=118}} In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became ''Al Kalb al Akbar'', &quot;the Greater Dog&quot;, transcribed as ''Alcheleb Alachbar'' by 17th century writer [[Edmund Chilmead]]. Islamic scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] referred to Orion as  ''Al Kalb al Jabbār'', &quot;the Dog of the Giant&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Among the [[Merazig]] of [[Tunisia]], shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called ''[[Merzem]]'', includes the stars of Canis Major and [[Canis Minor]] and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = La Ricerca Folklorica |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In non-western astronomy==

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the modern constellation of Canis Major lies in [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''), where the stars were classified in several separate [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s of stars. The Military Market (''Jūnshì'' 軍市) was a circular pattern of stars containing [[Nu3 Canis Majoris|Nu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]], [[Xi1 Canis Majoris|Xi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Xi2 Canis Majoris|Xi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and some stars from Lepus.{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=428}} The Wild Cockerel (''Yějī'' 野雞) was at the centre of the Military Market and its stars were uncertain. Schlegel reported that the stars [[Omicron Canis Majoris|Omicron]] and [[Pi Canis Majoris]] might have been them,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=430}} while Beta or [[Nu2 Canis Majoris|Nu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathcma&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canismajor.htm |work=Star Tales  | title=Canis Major – the Greater Dog |last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirius]] was ''Tiānláng'' (天狼), the Celestial Wolf,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=431}} denoting invasion and plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathcma&quot;/&gt; Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism ''Húshǐ'' (弧矢), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]], [[Epsilon Canis Majoris|Epsilon]], [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris]] and [[Delta Velorum]], or that the arrow was [[Omicron2 Canis Majoris|Omicron&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf) and the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, [[Sigma Canis Majoris|Sigma]], Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and [[Pi Puppis|Pi]] and [[Omicron Puppis]].{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=434}}

Both the [[Maori people]] and the people of the [[Tuamotus]] recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. ''Te Huinga-o-Rehua'', also called ''Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua'' and ''Te Kahui-Takurua'', (&quot;The Assembly of Rehua&quot; or &quot;The Assembly of Sirius&quot;) was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=215}} Related was ''Taumata-o-Rehua'', also called ''Pukawanui'', the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=258}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=247}} They called Sirius ''Rehua'' and ''Takarua'', corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though ''Rehua'' was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=249}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=254}} The Tuamotu people called Canis Major ''Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua'', &quot;the abiding assemblage of Takurua&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=236}}

The Tharumba people of the [[Shoalhaven River]] saw three stars of Canis Major as ''Wunbula'' (Bat) and his two wives ''Murrumbool'' (Mrs Brown Snake) and ''Moodtha'' (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation ''Munowra''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridley1875&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridley|first=William|title=Kámilarói, and other Australian languages|publisher=T.

== Characteristics ==
Canis Major is a constellation in the [[southern hemisphere]]'s summer (or northern hemisphere's winter) sky, bordered by [[Monoceros]] (which lies between it and [[Canis Minor]]) to the north, [[Puppis]] to the east and southeast, [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the southwest, and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CMa'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 4 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|06|12.5}} and {{RA|07|27.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −11.03° and −33.25°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Canis Major, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cma | accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering 380 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 43rd of the 88 currently-recognized constellations in size.&lt;ref name=bagnall&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Philip M. |title=The Star Atlas Companion: What You Need to Know about the Constellations |publisher=Springer  |location=New York, New York |year=2012 |isbn=1-4614-0830-X |pages=99–106|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KcIg02TKW6QC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Canis Major}}
The German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters [[Alpha]] through [[Omicron]] to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=71}} Bayer's countryman [[Johann Elert Bode]] later added Sigma, Tau and Omega,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}} while the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] added lettered stars a to k (though none are in use today).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}}  [[John Flamsteed]] numbered thirty one stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as [[Delta Columbae]] (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=368}} He also labelled two stars—his [[10 Canis Majoris|10]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris|13 Canis Majoris]]—as Kappa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Kappa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as [[Francis Baily]] and [[John Bevis]] dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the sole Kappa.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} Flamsteed's listing of Nu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Nu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Nu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Xi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Xi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Omicron&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Omicron&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have all remained in use.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=73-74}}

Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago, and another—[[NR Canis Majoris]]—will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.&lt;ref name=&quot;tomkin98&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomkin|first=Jocelyn|date=April 1998|title=Once and Future Celestial Kings|journal=Sky and Telescope|volume=95|issue=4|pages=59–63|bibcode=1998S&amp;T....95d..59T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] −1.44, Sirius is one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest stars to Earth]] at a distance of 8.6 [[light-year]]s. Its name comes from the Greek word for &quot;scorching&quot; or &quot;searing&quot;. It is a [[variable star]], the variation of approximately 0.1 magnitude having been discovered by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite. Sirius is also a [[binary star]]; its companion is called [[Sirius B]], which has a magnitude of 8.4. The two [[orbit]] each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the [[ancient Egyptian calendar]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} The star is marked the Great Dog's mouth on Bayer's star atlas.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=504}}

Flanking Sirius are Beta and [[Gamma Canis Majoris]]. Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a blue-white [[Beta Cephei variable]] star of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over a period of six hours.&lt;ref name=kaler&gt;{{cite web| first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | title=Mirzam | work=Stars | publisher=University of Illinois | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/mirzam.html | accessdate=2 January 2012 |date=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its traditional name means &quot;the announcer&quot;, referring to its position as the &quot;announcer&quot; of Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} Gamma, also known as Muliphein, is a fainter star of magnitude 4.12, in reality a blue-white bright giant of [[Stellar_classification#Spectral_types|spectral type]] B8IIe located 441 light years from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Gamma+CMa&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = Gamma Canis Majoris - Star in Cluster |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iota Canis Majoris]], lying between Sirius and Gamma, is another star that has been classified Beta Cephei variable, varying from magnitude 4.36 to 4.40 over a period of 1.92 hours.&lt;ref name=AAVSOiota&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=5507 |title=Iota Canis Majoris |author =Watson, Christopher |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is a remote blue-white supergiant of spectral type B3Ib, around 46,000 times as luminous as the sun and, at 2500 light-years distant, 300 times further away than Sirius.&lt;ref name=kalerkap&gt;{{cite web| first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | title=Iota Canis Majoris | work=Stars | publisher=University of Illinois | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/iotacma.html |date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive [[star formation]] in both galaxies.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia [[SN 1975a]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirshner, Robert P.; Arp, H.C.; Dunlap, J.R.|year=1976|title=Observations of Supernovae - 1975a in NGC 2207 and 1975b in the Perseus Cluster|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=207|issue=1|pages=44–52.|bibcode=1976ApJ...207...44K|last2=Arp|last3=Dunlap|doi=10.1086/154465}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1999 (the type Ib [[SN 1999ec]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jha, S.; Garnavich, P.; Challis, P.; Kirshner, R.; Berlind, P.|year=1999|title=Supernova 1999ec in NGC 2207|journal=IAUC|volume=7269|page=2|bibcode=1999IAUC.7269....2J|last2=Garnavich|first2=P.|last3=Challis|first3=P.|last4=Kirshner|first4=R.|last5=Berlind|first5=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 (type 1b supernova [[SN 2003H]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Bishop | title=Bright Supernovae - 2003 | publisher=Rochester University | url=http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2003/ | accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013 (type II supernova [[SN 2013ai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conseil, E.; Fraser, M.; Inserra, C.; Walton, N.; Blagorodnova, N.; Nicholl, M.; Benetti, S.; Pastorello, A.; Valenti, S.; Taubenberger, S.; Smartt, S.J.; Smith, K.; Young, D.; Sullivan, M.; Gal-Yam, A.; Yaron, O.|year=2013|title=Supernova 2013ai in NGC 2207 = Psn J06161835-2122329|journal=Central Bureau Electronic Telegrams|volume=3431|issue=3431|page=1|bibcode=2013CBET.3431....1C|last2=Fraser|first2=M.|last3=Inserra|first3=C.|last4=Walton|first4=N.|last5=Blagorodnova|first5=N.|last6=Nicholl|first6=M.|last7=Benetti|first7=S.|last8=Pastorello|first8=A.|last9=Valenti|first9=S.|last10=Taubenberger|first10=S.|last11=Smartt|first11=S.
